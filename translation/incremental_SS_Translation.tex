\begin{itemize}
    \item [1.1]
    Now I shall narrate the chapter, the origin of this knowledge.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa 
    understands the word "\saneng{veda}{knowledge}" as specifically "medical knowledge."  
    He says that the word "longevity" (\emph{āyur}) \ssaneng{āyur}{life, longevity}
     has been elided.}
    
%    Notes Dec 8:
%    Dominik: N's ādhyāyaṃ corruption of H's nāmādhyāyaṃ: possible evidence that N was created 
%after H
%    Check: Ācārya 1931 footnote on vedotpattim
%    Commentary Ḍalhaṇa (c. 1200 CE) notes āyur dropped from veda in vedotpattim
%    
    
    \item[1.2]\footnote{At this point, later manuscripts and commentaries include the 
    statement "as the venerable Dhanvantari stated."  The absence of this statement in the 
    early Nepalese MSS is noteworthy.}
%     <!-- Notes Dec 8:
%    Dom: note the omission of Dhanvantari, which is in the edition.
%    On Dhanvantari, see Meulenbeld HIM, authorities associated with Suśruta. He's an authority on 
%surgery or toxicology-->
    
    \item[1.3] Now, it is said that Aupadhenava, Vaitaraṇa, Aurabhra, Puṣkalāvata,
Karavīra, Gopurarakṣita, Bhoja, Suśruta and [others] spoke to Lord Divodāsa,
the best of the gods, who was in his ashram surrounded by an entourage of
sages.\footnote{On these persons, see \cite[IA 369\,ff.]{meul-hist}. 
\citet{kleb-2021} has discussed these authors in the context of an anonymous commentary 
on the \SS\ that cites them.}
    
%    Notes Dec 8:
%    Dom: Check these names in Meulenbeld 
%    Bhoja is an early lost authority on medicine. Not the same person as King Bhoja, commentator 
%on the Yogasūtras.
%    Ḍalhaṇa's comm. mentions Bhoja as also included in prabhṛtayaḥ: so the version of the text he 
%was using did not mention Bhoja, but he was aware of him: His provenance makes it possible that 
%he knew the Nepalese version of the SŚ
    
    \item[1.4]
O Lord, after seeing people who are assailed by the impingements of various pains caused by 
physical, mental and accidental diseases, who have the support of friends [but] feeling as if they 
were alone, and acting frantically, shouting out, we have been distressed. 
    
%    Notes Dec 8:
%    āgantu - caused by something from outside the body
%    abhighāta - threats, impingements 
%    vedanābhighāta - tatpuruṣa 
%    anātha - among a list of people who shouldn't be treated.
%    Ḍalhaṇa- sanātha: samitra someone with a friend -->
    
   
    
    \item [1.28] Thus, living creatures and their strength,
\saneng{varṇa}{complexion} and \saneng{ojas}{energy} are rooted in food.  That
(food) depends on the six \saneng{rasa}{flavours}. Thus, the flavours depend
on \saneng{dravya}{substance}, and substances depend on medicinal herbs. 
There are two kinds of them (herbs):  stationary and mobile.\footnote{Suśruta
sū.1.28\footcites[I, 21]{shar-susr}[7]{susr-trikamji2004}.}
