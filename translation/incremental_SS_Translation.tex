        The \href{http://sushrutaproject.org}{Suśruta Project} is producing 
        \href{https://saktumiva.org/wiki/wujastyk/susrutasamhita/01-su.su/provisional-edition_sutrasthana}{a
         new Sanskrit text edition} of the 
        \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} based on the early Nepalese manuscripts.  As we 
        gradually transcribe 
        and edit the manuscripts, we are producing this new translation of the classic 
        work.

\begin{itemize}
    \item [1]
    Now I shall narrate the chapter on the origin of this knowledge.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa 
    understands the word "\saneng{veda}{knowledge}" as specifically "medical knowledge."  
    He says that the word "longevity" (\emph{āyur}) \ssaneng{āyur}{life, longevity}
     has been elided.}
    
%    Notes Dec 8:
%    Dominik: N's ādhyāyaṃ corruption of H's nāmādhyāyaṃ: possible evidence that N was created 
%after H
%    Check: Ācārya 1931 footnote on vedotpattim
%    Commentary Ḍalhaṇa (c. 1200 CE) notes āyur dropped from veda in vedotpattim
%    
    
    \item[2]\footnote{At this point, later manuscripts and commentaries include the 
    statement "as the venerable Dhanvantari stated."  The absence of this statement in the 
    early Nepalese MSS is noteworthy. See the discussion of \cite{kleb-2021b}.}
%     <!-- Notes Dec 8:
%    Dom: note the omission of Dhanvantari, which is in the edition.
%    On Dhanvantari, see Meulenbeld HIM, authorities associated with Suśruta. He's an authority on 
%surgery or toxicology-->
    
    \item[3] Now, as is well-known, Aupadhenava, Vaitaraṇa, Aurabhra, Puṣkalāvata,
Karavīra, Gopurarakṣita, Bhoja, Suśruta and others addressed Lord Divodāsa,
king of Kāśi, the best of the immortals, who was in his ashram surrounded by
an entourage of sages.\footnote{On these persons, see \cite[IA
369\,ff.]{meul-hist}. \citet{kleb-2021a} has discussed these authors in the
context of an anonymous commentary on the \SS\ that cites them.}

\nocite{emen-1969}
    
%    Notes Dec 8:
%    Dom: Check these names in Meulenbeld 
%    Bhoja is an early lost authority on medicine. Not the same person as King Bhoja, commentator 
%on the Yogasūtras.
%    Ḍalhaṇa's comm. mentions Bhoja as also included in prabhṛtayaḥ: so the version of the text he 
%was using did not mention Bhoja, but he was aware of him: His provenance makes it possible that 
%he knew the Nepalese version of the SŚ
    
    \item[4]
%O Lord, after seeing people who are assailed by the impingements of various pains 
%caused by 
%physical, mental and accidental diseases, who have the support of friends [but] 
%feeling as if they 
%were alone, and acting frantically, shouting out, we have been distressed. 

“O Lord, distress arose in our minds after witnessing people thrashing about with
cries, assailed by different kinds of \saneng{vedanābhighāta}{pain and injury}, 
feeling helpless in spite 
of having friends, because of diseases arising from the body, the mind and
external sources.


    
%    Notes Dec 8:
%    āgantu - caused by something from outside the body
%    abhighāta - threats, impingements 
%    vedanābhighāta - tatpuruṣa 
%    anātha - among a list of people who shouldn't be treated.
%    Ḍalhaṇa- sanātha: samitra someone with a friend -->

“To quell the illnesses of those who seek happiness and for our own purpose of
prolonging life, we desire \saneng{āyurveda}{the science of life} that is being
taught.  Welfare\ssaneng{śreyas}{welfare}, both in this world and in
    the next, depends upon it. Therefore, we have come to the Lord in pupillage." %
% reading bhagavan (voc.) and tam (it, ayurveda, masc. acc.)

% we think upasannāḥ smaḥ is probably wrong, but we can't see how to improve it.

\item[5] The Lord said to them:

“Welcome to you!  My children, all of you are beyond reproach and worthy 
to be taught.
   
    
    \item[6]   \footnote{The relative pronoun \emph{yad} has no correlative.}
    
    \item[7]
    
    
    
    \item [28] Thus, living creatures and their strength,
\saneng{varṇa}{complexion} and \saneng{ojas}{energy} are rooted in food.  That
(food) depends on the six \saneng{rasa}{flavours}. Thus, the flavours depend
on \saneng{dravya}{substance}, and substances depend on medicinal herbs. 
There are two kinds of them (herbs):  stationary and mobile.\footnote{Suśruta
sū.1.28 \cite[I, 21]{shar-susr}, \cite[7]{susr-trikamji2004}.}
