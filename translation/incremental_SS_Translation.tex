        \section{The Manuscripts used in the Vulgate editions by 
        Yādavaśarma Trivikrama Ācārya}
    
        Yādavaśarma Trivikrama Ācārya produced three successive editions of the \SS\ 
        with the commentary of Ḍalhaṇa, in 1915, 1931 and 1938.  These editions, 
        especially the last, are considered the most scholarly and reliable editions of the 
        work, and have been constantly reprinted up to the present day.
        
        The 1915 edition was based on three manuscripts.  The 1931 edition used 
        another nine.  For his final 1938 edition, Ācārya used a further 
        three.\footnote{\cite[22]{susr-trikamji3}.}
        
        \subsection{The manuscripts of the 1915 edition}
        
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item[1] Calcutta, Royal Asiatic Society.  Covers the sūtra, nidāna, śārīra and 
            kalpa sthānas.  
            
            \item [2] Jaipur, Pandit Gaṅgādharabhaṭṭaśarman, lecturer at the Royal 
            Sanskrit University.  Covers the cikitsāsthānna and the uttaratantra.
            
            \item [3]  Bundi, my great friend the royal physician Paṃ.\ Śrīprasādaśarman  
            Covers the uttaratantra.
        \end{enumerate}
        
        \subsection{The manuscripts of the 1931 edition}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item[1] Vārāṇasī, professor of literature, the great Gaurīnāthapāṭhaka.  With the 
    \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}. Covers the nidānasthāna and uttaratantra.
    
    \item [2]  Ahmedabad.  My friend Sva.\ Vā.\ Vaidya Raṇachoḍalāla Motīlālaśarman.  
    With the \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}.  Covers the śārīrasthāna.
    
    \item [3] From the library of my great friend Sva.\ Vā.\ Vaidya Murārajīśarman.  
    Extremely old. No commentary.  Covers the śārīrasthāna. 
    
    \item [4]  Puṇe, BORI library.  With the \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}. Covers the
śārīrasthāna.\footnote{Not one of the three MSS of the
\emph{śārīrasthāna}described in \cite{shar-vaid}.}
    
    \item [5]  Puṇe, BORI library.  With the \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}. Complete.  
    With some damaged folia.
    
    \item [6]  Bombay, Asiatic Society.  Incomplete.\footnote{Possibly \MScite{Mumbai, 
    AS B.I.3} or \MScite{Mumbai, AS B.D.109} \citep[v.\,1, \# 212 and 
    213]{vela-1930}.  But both these have the \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}.  The first 
    covers only the śārīrasthāna; the second may be complete, but Velankar calls it 
    only “disorderly.”}
    
    \item [7]

\begin{translation}

    \item[1] Now I shall narrate the chapter on the origin of this
knowledge.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa understood the word "\se{veda}{knowledge}" as
specifically "medical knowledge." He said that the word "longevity"
(\emph{āyur}) \ssaneng{āyur}{life, longevity} had been elided.
%    
%    Notes Dec 8:
%    Dominik: N's ādhyāyaṃ corruption of H's nāmādhyāyaṃ: possible evidence that N was created 
%after H
%    Check: Ācārya 1931 footnote on vedotpattim
%    Commentary Ḍalhaṇa (c. 1200 CE) notes āyur dropped from veda in vedotpattim
%    
%    
After this opening statement, later manuscripts and commentaries include
the attribution, "as the venerable Dhanvantari stated."  The absence of this
statement in the early Nepalese MSS is highly noteworthy because it removes
the outer narrative frame of the \SS\
\parencites[148]{wuja-2013}[\S\,3.1.2]{kleb-2021b}.  On the figure of Dhanvatari in 
medical literature, see \cite[IA 358--361]{meul-hist}.} %     <!-- Notes Dec 8:

    \item[2] Now, as is well-known, Aupadhenava, Vaitaraṇa, Aurabhra, Puṣkalāvata,
Karavīra, Gopurarakṣita, Bhoja, Suśruta and others addressed Lord Divodāsa,
king of Kāśi, the best of the immortals, who was in his ashram surrounded by
an entourage of sages.\footnote{On these persons, see \cite[IA
361--363, 369\,ff.]{meul-hist}. The authority Bhoja does not appear in the list as
published in the vulgate edition \citep[1]{susr-trikamji2}, and was not
included in \cite{meul-hist} amongst “authorities mentioned in the \SS.” 
\citeauthor{meul-hist} gathered textual evidence about Bhoja at \cite[IA
690--691]{meul-hist}. \citet{kleb-2021a} has discussed these authors in the
context of an anonymous commentary on the \SS\ that cites them.}

%was using did not mention Bhoja, but he was aware of him: His provenance makes it possible that

        \item[28] In this context, as far as this discipline is concerned, a 
        \se{puruṣa}{human being} is called an amalgam of the five elements 
        and the embodied soul.  This is where \se{kriyā}{procedures} apply. This 
        is the locus. 
        
        Why?
        
        Because of the duality of the world, the world is twofold: the stationary
and the moving. Its \se{ātmaka}{nature} is twofold, depending on the
preponderance of Agni and Soma.\footcite[See][]{wuja-2004}  Alternatively,
it can be considered as being fivefold.  The multitude of beings in it are
fourfold: they are termed “sweat-born, stone-born, caul-born and
egg-born”.\footnote{This fourfold classification of beings is paralleled
with closely-related vocabulary in  \emph{Bhelasaṃhitā} 4.4.4	
\parencites[206]{kris-2000}[81]{mook-1921}.}  Where they are concerned, the
human being is the main thing; others are his support.  Therefore, the
\se{puruṣa}{human being} is the locus.

\item[29]  Diseases are said to be the conjunction of the person and 
\se{duḥkha}{suffering}.
 There are four of them: invasive, bodily, mental and inherent.  The invasive ones 
 are caused by an injury.  The bodily ones are based on food, caused by 
 \se{vaiṣamya}{irregularities} in wind, bile, phlegm and blood.\footnote{Note 
 that four humoral substances are assumed here.} 
 
The \se{mānasa}{mental} ones, caused by 
\se{icchā}{desire} and 
\se{dveṣa}{hatred}, 
include:  
\se{krodha}{anger}, 
\se{āśoka}{grief}, 
\se{dainya}{misery}, 
\se{harṣa}{overexcitement}, 
 \se{kāma}{lust}, 
 \se{viṣāda}{depression},
 \se{īrṣyā}{envy},
 \se{asūyā}{jealousy},
 \se{mātsarya}{malice}, 
 and
 \se{lobha}{greed}.
 
 The \se{svābhāvika}{inherent} ones are hunger, thirst, old age, death, 
 sleep and  those of the \se{prakṛti}{temperament}.
 
 These too are \se{adhiṣṭhāna}{located} in the mind and body.
 
\se{lekhana}{Scarification},
\se{bṛṃhaṇa}{nourishment},
\se{saṃśodhana}{purification},
 \se{saṃśamana}{pacification},
 \se{āhāra}{diet} and

 properly employed, bring about their cure.

    energy}. It \se{āyatta}{depends on} the six \se{rasa}{flavours}.
Flavours, furthermore, have substances as their \se{āśrayin}{substrate}.  And
substances are \se{oṣadhī-}{remedies}.\footnote{Pāṇini 6.3.132 provides that
the final vowel of the noun \emph{oṣadhi} may be lengthened
(\emph{$\rightarrow$oṣadhī}) under certain conditions.  These conditions require
that the word be used in a Vedic mantra and not in the nominative.  Neither
condition is met in this passage, yet the author uses the form \emph{oṣadhī}. 
This form is in fact not uncommon in medical literature as well as in epics,
purāṇas, smṛtis, and other parts of Sanskrit literature.} There are 
two types:
\se{sthāvara}{stationary} and \se{jaṅgama}{moving}.



\item [31]  Of these, there are four types of stationary ones:
\se{vanaspati}{fruit trees}, \se{vṛkṣa}{flowering trees},
\se{oṣadhi}{herbs} and \se{vīrudh}{shrubs}.\footnote{Ca.sū.1.71--72 
also
describes these four types of medicinal plant in similar terms but with slightly
differing names: \emph{oṣadhi} is a plant that ends after fruiting, \emph{vīrudh}
is a plant that branches out, \emph{vanaspati} is a tree with fruit, and
\emph{vānaspatya} is a tree with fruit and flowers.}
Amongst these, the “fruit trees” have fruit but no flowers.\footnote{The MSS agree 
in reading \emph{phalavantyaḥ} “having flowers” which is grammatically 
non-standard. This form is also found in the  \emph{Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa} 
(1.92.27, \cite[1.92.27][56r]{sarm-1912}).}  The “flowering trees” 
have flowers and fruit.  The “herbs” die when the fruit is ripe. “Shrubs” put out 
shoots.

% \citep{ober-2003} didn't have anything on phalavantyo that I could find quickly.


   \item[32]  As is well known, moving remedies are also of four types: those
\se{jarāyuja}{born in in a caul}, those \se{aṇḍaja}{born from eggs},
those \se{svedaja}{born of sweat}, and \se{udbhid}{shoots}. Amongst
these, those born in a caul include \se{paśu}{animals}, humans, and
\se{vyāla}{wild animals}.  Birds, \se{sarīsṛpa}{creepy-crawlies} and
snakes are “born of eggs.” \se{kṛmi}{Worms}, \se{kunta}{small insects}
and \se{pipīlika}{ants} and others are born of sweat.\footnote{The word
\emph{kunta}, though marked as “lexical” in most dictionaries, is in fact found
in literature, commonly as a compound with \emph{pipīlika}; the compound
sometimes seems to be understood a type of ant (\emph{tatpuruṣa} compound)
rather than as a pair of insects (\emph{dvandva} compound).}  Shoots include
\se{indragopa}{red velvet mites} and \se{maṇḍūka}{frogs}.\footnote{On
\emph{indragopa}, see \cite{lien-1978}.}|

\item[33] In this context, among the stationary remedies, 
\se{tvak}{skin}, 
\se{patra}{leaves}, 
\se{puṣpa}{flowers}, 
\se{phala}{fruits},
\se{mūla}{roots},
\se{kanda}{bulbs},
\se{kṣīra}{sap},
\se{niryāsa}{resin},
\se{sāra}{essence},
\se{sneha}{oil}, 
and
\se{svarasa}{juice extract}\footnote{On \se{svarasa}{juice extract} see
CS 1.1.73, 1.4.7; \VN{4.10.12}{}.} 
are useful; among the moving remedies 
\se{carman}{pelt}, hair, nails, and 
\se{rudhira}{blood} and so forth. 

 \item[34] And \se{pārthiva}{earthen products} include gold and 
 silver.\footnote{The flow of concepts in the treatise seems to be interrupted here.}
 
\item[35] The \se{kālakṛta}{items created by time} are \se{samplava}{clusters} 
as far as wind and \se{nivāta}{no wind}, heat and shade, darkness and light
and the cold, hot and \se{varṣā}{rainy seasons} are concerned. 
The divisions of time are the
\se{nimeṣa}{blink of the eye}, a
\se{kāṣṭhā}{trice}, 
\se{kalā}{minutes}, 
\se{muhūrta}{three-quarters of an hour}, a
\se{ahorātra}{day and night}, a
\se{pakṣa}{fortnight}, a
\se{māsa}{month}, a
\se{ṛtu}{season}, a
\se{ayana}{half-year}, a
\se{saṃvatsara}{year},
and
\se{yuga}{yuga}.\footnote{These units are presented at 
\VN{1.6.5}{} and discussed by \citet[\S\,59]{haya-2017}.}


\item[36]  These naturally cause 
\se{sañcaya}{accumulation}, 
\se{prakopa}{irritation}, 
\se{upaśama}{pacification} 
and 
\se{pratīkāra}{alleviation} of the \se{doṣa}{humours}. And they have
    \se{prayojanavat}{practical purposes}.

        \item [1] Now we shall expound the method for
        the piercing of the ear. 
        
        \item [2] One may pierce a child's ears for the purpose of preserving and 
        decorating.
     
     During the first half of the sixth or seventh lunar month,
during a renowned day, half day, hour and constellation the child who has
\se{kṛtamaṅgala}{received a benediction}, -- \se{svastiv\=acana}{blessings
    pronounced} -- should be placed on the lap of a wet-nurse.\footnote{The
syntax here is unclear. The expression \emph{svastiv\=acana} may have been
a gloss inserted into the text at an earlier period to clarify
\emph{ma\.ngala}.  But as it stands, it is not syntactically connected to
the rest of the sentence.  The Vulgate records a reading in which the
words are united in a compound that reads more naturally.} For a boy, do
the right one first; for a girl do the left one. Use a needle on a
thin ear; an \se{ārā}{awl} on a thick one.


     \item [3]  If there is excess blood or pain one should know that it was pierced
     in the wrong place. The absence of side-effects is a sign that it has been pierced 
     in the right place.\footnote{From here on, witness K is missing a folio, so the text 
     is contstructed on the basis of witnesses N and H.}
     
     \item [4] In this context, if an ignorant person accidentally pierces a 
     \se{sirā}{duct} there will 
     be fever, burning, \se{śvayathu}{swelling}, pain, \se{granthi}{lumps}, 
     \se{manyāstambhā}{paralysis 
     of the nape of the neck}, 
     \se{apatānaka}{convulsions}, headache or pain in the ear. 
     
\item[5]     Having removed the \se{varti}{wick} in it, one should smear it with
a paste of the roots of 
barley, 
liquorice, 
\se{mañjiṣṭhā}{Indian madder}, and the
\se{gandharvahasta}{castor oil tree},
thickened with honey and ghee.

When it has healed well, one should pierce it again.

\item[6] One should treat the properly-pierced ear by sprinkling it raw sesame
oil.   After every three days one should apply a thicker \se{varti}{wick} and
sprinkle oil right on it.\footnote{The manuscripts support the reading
\emph{sthūlatarīṃ} that is either a non-standard form or a scribal error.}

\item[7]
Once the ear is free from humours or side-effects, one should 
loosen it with a light \se{pravardhanaka}{dilator} in order to enlarge it.

\item[8]

\begin{sloka}

An person's ear enlarged in this way can split in two, either as a result of the 
humours or as a result of a blow.  

Listen to me about the \se{sandhāna}{joins} it 
can have. 

\end{sloka}

Here, there are, in brief, fifteen ways of mending the ear.  They are as follows:
Rim-join, Lotus-splittable, Dried Flesh, Fastening, Cheek-ear, Take away,
Ready-Split, Multi-joins, Door-hinge, Half door-hinge, 
\se{saṃkṣipta}{Compressed}, Reduced-ear,
Creeper-ear, Stick-ear, and Crow's lip.

In this context, among these, 
\begin{description}

    \item[\mdseries``Rim-join'' (\emph{nemīsandhānaka}):]
    both flaps are wide, long, and equal.

    \item[\mdseries``Lotus-splittable'' (\emph{utpalabhedyaka}):]
    both flaps are round, long, and equal.

    \item[\mdseries``Dried flesh'' (\emph{vallūraka}):]
    both flaps are short, round, and equal.

    \item[\mdseries``Fastening'' (\emph{āsaṅgima}):]
    one flap is longer on the inside.

    \item[\mdseries``Cheek-ear'' (\emph{gaṇḍakarṇa}):]
    one flap is longer on the outside.\footnote{See fig.~\ref{fig:gandakarna}.}

    \item[\mdseries``Take-away'' (\emph{āhārya}):]
    the flaps are missing, in fact, on both sides.

    \item[\mdseries``Ready-split'' (\emph{nirvedhima}):]
the flaps are like a \se{pīṭha}{dais}.

    \item[\mdseries``Multi-joins'' (\emph{vyāyojima}):]
    one flap is small, the other thick, one flap is equal, the other unequal.

    \item[\mdseries``Door-hinge'' (\emph{kapāṭasandhika}):]
    the flap on the inside is long, the other is small.

    \item[\mdseries``Half door-hinge'' (\emph{ardhakapāṭasandhika}):]
    the flap on the outside is long, the other is small.
\end{description}
    
    `These ten \se{vikalpa}{options} for \se{sandhi}{joins} of the ear should be
bound.  They can mostly be explained as resembling their names.\footnote{This
is an odd assertion, given the strangeness of the names.}  The five below are
not so successful:
    
% got to here. 2021-03-12    

The five from \se{saṃkṣipta}{compressed} on are incurable.  Among these, 
“compressed” has a dry ear canal and the other flap is small.   “Reduced ear” has 
flaps that have no base and have wasted flesh on their edges. “Creeper-ear” has 
flaps that are thin and uneven. “Stick-ear” has \se{granthita}{lumpy} flesh and the 
flaps are stretched thin and have \se{stabdha}{stiff} \se{sirā}{ducts}.  “Crow-lip” 
has a flap 
without flesh with \se{saṃkṣipta}{compressed} tips and little blood. Even when 
they are bound up, they do not heal because they are hot, inflamed, 
\se{srāva}{suppurating}, or swollen.

\item[10]  

% 15
A person wishing to perform any of these joins should therefore gather together the
supplies prepared according to the recommendations of the `Preparatory
Supplies' chapter.\footnote{SS.1.5.}  And in particular, he should gather
\se{decanted liquor}{surāmaṇḍa}, milk, water,
\se{fermented rice-water}{dhānyāmla}, and \se{kapālacūrṇa}{powdered 
earthenware crockery}.  

Next, he should prepare the woman or man who have had the ends of their hair tied 
up, have eaten lightly, and are firmly supported by qualified 
attendants.

Then, he should ready the \se{bandha}{bindings} and carry out the procedure with
\se{chedya}{cutting}, \se{bhedya}{splitting}, \se{lekhya}{scarification}, or
\se{vyadhana}{piercing}, examine the blood of the ear to know whether it is 
\se{tainted}{duṣṭa} or not.  Then if it is tainted by wind, the ear should be
bathed with \se{fermented rice-water}{dhānyāmla} and water; if tainted by choler, 
then cold water
and milk should be used; if tainted by phlegm, then \se{decanted 
liquor}{surāmaṇḍa} and water
should be used, and then he should scarify it again.


Then, arranging the join in the ear so that it is neither proud, depressed, nor
uneven, one should make the join. Next, after anointing it with honey and ghee,
each ear should be bandaged with \se{cotton}{picu} and \se{gauze}{prota}, and
bound up with a thread, neither too tightly nor too loosely.  Then the earthenware
powder should be sprinkled on, and \se{medical advice}{ācārika} should be given.
And he should supplement with food as taught in  the `Two Wound'
chapter.\footnote{SS.4.1.}

\item[11]
\begin{sloka}
    One should avoid rubbing, sleeping during the day, exercise, overeating,
    sex, getting hot by a fire, or the effort of speaking.
\end{sloka}

\item[12]

% 17
One should not make a join when the blood is too pure, too copious, or too
thin.\footnote{The vulgate reads “impure” for the Nepalese “too pure,” which would
appear to make better medical sense.  Emending the text to \emph{nāśuddha-} for
\emph{nātiśuddha-} in the Nepalese recension would yield the same meaning as the
vulgate.} For when the ear is tainted by wind, then it is
\se{raktabaddha}{obstructed by blood}, unhealed and will peel.\ When tainted with
choler, is becomes \se{gāḍha}{pinched}, \se{pāka}{septic} and red.  When tainted
by phlegm, it will be \se{stabdha}{stiff} and itchy.  It has excessively copious
\se{srāva}{suppuration} and is \se{puffed up}{śopha}.  It has it has a small
amount of \se{kṣīṇa}{wasted} flesh and it will not grow.\footnote{This passage
exemplifies numerous small changes }

\item[13] When the ear is properly healed and there are no complications,  one may
very gradually start to expand it.  Otherwise, it may be \se{saṃrambha}{angry},
burning, septic or painful.  It may even be split open again.

\section{Uttaratantra, adhyāya 17}

\begin{translation}
    
    \item[1]  Now I shall explain the \se{pratiṣedha}{counteraction} of diseases
located in the \se{dṛṣṭi}{pupil}.
    
    \item[2]  There are three \se{sādhya}{curable}, three \se{asādhya}{incurable},
and six \se{yāpya}{mitigatible} diseases located in peoples eyes. Among these,
three are \se{sādhya}{curable}. Amongst these three, %\item[3]
the \se{pratīkāra}{remedy} has been stated for the one called
“\se{dhūmadarśin}{seeing smoke}”.\footnote{This disease and its cure are 
described earlier (SS.6.7.39 and SS.6.10.16 
\citep[609 and 614]{V} respectively). The latter part of this verse is
hard to construe and the text here may have been altered at an early period.}

\item[3--5ab]  When the eye is \se{vidagdha}{inflamed} by bile and when it is 
inflamed 
by phlegm, one should apply the method for removing bile and phlegm, using 
\se{nasya}{nasal medicines}, 
\se{seka}{irrigation},
\se{añjana}{collyrium},
\se{ālepa}{liniment}, and 
\se{puṭapāka}{medicines cooked in a crucible},
together with a \se{tarpaṇa}{balm},\footnote{These therapies are described in 
SS.6.18 
\citep[633--640]{V}.} but not 
\se{śastrakṣata}{cutting with a blade}.\q{where is cutting with a knife related to 
removing bile or phlegm.}\footnote{Dalhaṇa interprets this as 
\se{sirāvedha}{blood-letting}, which is discussed in SS.1.14 \citep[]{V}.}

One should drink \se{sarpis}{ghee} prepared with the \se{triphalā}{three fruits} 
and in the first [case where the problem is bile], and \se{traivṛta}{prepared with 
turpeth} in the 
latter [case, of phlegm].

And ghee \se{tailvaka}{prepared with tilvaka} is wholesome in both cases, or else 
aged ghee on its own.

%gairika Hellwig 140-141
\item[5cd--7ab]

In a collyrium, these four \se{yoga}{compounds} are beneficial in both cases:
\begin{itemize}
 
    \item \se{gairika}{ochre}, \se{saindhava}{Sind salt}, \se{kṛṣṇā}{long pepper} 
    and the \se{maṣī}{black soot} from cow's teeth;\q{maṣī burned charcoal. Find 
    refs.}

\item \se{gomāṃsa}{Cow's flesh}, \se{marica}{black pepper}, \se{śirīṣa}{siris}
and \se{manaḥśilā}{red arsenic};

\item 
\se{vṛnta}{stalk} from a
\se{kapittha}{wood apple} with
\se{madhu}{honey};\footnote{\se{kapittha}{wood apple} in this verse is ablative 
singular or accusative plural, neither of which construe obviously.}

\item
or the the fruits of the \se{svayaṃgupta}{velvet bean}.
\end{itemize}

\item [8]

The physician should make a collyrium with ground up 
\se{kupyaka}{metal},\footnote{A metal other than gold or silver, according to 
\cite[1.217]{josi-maha}.  Perhaps lead, which is used in making contemporary 
collyrium.}
\se{aśoka}{Asoka tree},
\se{śālā}{Sal tree},
\se{amra}{mango},
\se{priyaṃgu}{beautyberry},
\se{nalina}{Indian lotus},
\se{utpala}{blue lotus}, 
together with
\se{hareṇu}{hareṇu},
\se{āmalaka}{emblic},
\se{pathyā}{myrobalan},
\se{pippali}{long pepper}.  
It should be combined with ghee and 
\se{kṣaudra}{honey}.


\item[9--10]

Also, when bile and phlegm have developed, the physician should apply
\se{hareṇu}{hareṇu} with the \se{svarasa}{expressed juice} of the 
flowers
from \se{amra}{mango} and \se{jambū}{Jambu} trees.

Then this collyrium, \se{vipakva}{matured} with ghee and \se{kṣaudra}{honey},
should then be applied.

\item[10--11ab]

\se{kiñjalka}{Filaments} of \se{nalina}{Indian lotus} and \se{utpala}{blue lotus},
with \se{gairika}{ochre}, and the juice of \se{gośakṛt}{cow-dung} are a collyrium
in the form of a  \se{guḍikā}{pill}.  This is good for both day and night
blindness.

\item[11cd--12ab]
 
 \se{rasāñjana}{Elixir-salve}, \se{kṣaudra}{honey}, ghee, \se{tālīśa}{scramberry},
together with gold and ochre, with the \se{gośakṛt}{juice of cow-dung} are for an
eye afflicted with bile.

\item [12cd--13] 

Alternatively, wise physician should first grind together \se{śīta}{elixir-salve}
and \se{sauvīraka}{fermented barley}, \se{bhāvita}{infused} with \se{rasa}{the
    blood of birds and animals}.\footnote{This is Ḍalhaṇa's preferred interpretation
of \emph{rasa} “juice” in this context.  He also notes that some take
\se{śīta}{elixir-salve} to be camphor.}  Then he mixes it with the bile of a
tortoise or with \se{rauhita}{extract of rohu carp}.  It should always be used
with powdered collyrium to quell the bile.

\item[14]

Thus, a collyrium of \se{kārśmarī}{white teak} flowers, \se{madhuka}{liquorice},
\se{dārvī}{tree turmeric}, \se{lodhra}{lodh tree} and \se{rasāñjana}{elixir salve}
is always good as a collyrium in this case.


\item [15]

Alternatively, for those who cannot see during the day, this \se{guḍikā}{pill},
with sandalwood, is recommended: \se{nadīja}{salt}, conch shell and the three
spices, collyrium, \se{manaḥśilā}{realgar}, the two
\se{rajana}{turmerics}\footnote{Turmeric (Curcuma longa \textit{Linn.}) and tree
turmeric (Berberis aristata DC).  The term \emph{rajana} is unusual; the normal
term is \emph{rajanī}. \emph{Rajana} occurs in \emph{Suśrutanighaṇṭu} 158 in the
sense of Ferula asafoetida, Linn.} and \se{yakṛdrasa}{liver
    extract}.\footnote{This verse appears as no.\,27 in the vulgate.}

\item [16] One should grind up \se{srotoja}{kohl},\footnote{Glossed by Ḍalhaṇa as
a kind of collyrium.  Cf.\ \cite[2.M13]{nadk-1954} and \cite[197--198]{shar-1982}}
and \se{saindhava}{Sind salt} and long pepper and also \se{hareṇu}{hareṇu}.  
Such wicks with goats urine are good in a collyrium for
\se{kṣaṇadāndhya}{night blindness}.

\item [17--18ab] Alternatively, in such a case, grind together
\se{kālānusāriva}{Indian sarsaparilla}\footnote{There are two forms of
\emph{sārivā} mentioned widely in Āyurvedic literature, the white and the black.
Ideas on the identity of the black form are particularly fluid.  See
\citet[434--438]{adps} for a clear discussion.} long pepper, \se{nāgara}{dried
    ginger} and honey, the leaf of the \se{tālīśapatra}{scramberry}, the two
\se{rajana}{turmerics}, a conch shell and \se{yakṛdrasa}{liver extract}. %
Then shade-dried wicks take away \se{ruj}{illness}.


\item[18cd--19ab]

Wicks made of \se{manaḥśilā}{red arsenic},
\se{abhayā}{chebulic myrobalan},
\se{vyoṣa}{the three spices}.
\se{sāriva}{Indian sarsaparilla}, 
\se{samudraphena}{cuttlefish bone}, 
combined with goat's milk are good.

\item[19cd--21ab]

One should cook a \se{kṣaudrāñjana}{honey collyrium} either in the juices of
\se{gomūtra}{cow's urine}, and bile, \se{madirā}{spirits}, \se{yakṛt}{liver}, and
\se{dhātrī}{emblic} or else in the juice of the \se{yakṛt}{liver} of something
different, or else with the extract of the \se{triphalā}{three fruits}. %
One of these should be mixed with cow urine, ghee and \se{arṇavamala}{cuttle
    fish}\footnote{At SS 6.12.31, Ḍalhaṇa glossed \emph{arṇavamala} as
\se{samudraphena}{cuttlefish bone}. It may be worth considering whether the
unusual term \emph{arṇavamala} “ocean-filth” might refer to ambergris.} with long
pepper, honey and \se{kaṭphala}{box myrtle}. It is placed in sea salt and stored
in a bamboo tube.

\item[21cd--22]

One should cook the liver of a sheep, the ghee of a goat, with long pepper and Sindh 
salt, honey and the juice of emblics.  Then one should store it properly in a catechu 
box.  Prepared thus, the honey collyrium is good. 


\item[23]

Alternatively, a collyrium that is \se{hareṇu}{hareṇu} mixed with
\se{māgadhī}{long pepper}, the bone and the marrow of a goat, 
\se{elā}{cardamom}
and liver, together with liver extract, is good for eyes afflicted by
phlegm.\footnote{On the identities of \emph{elā} and \emph{hareṇu}
\citet[511\,ff]{watt-comm} described the former as “true” or “lesser” or “Malabar”
cardamom, Elettaria cardamomum, Maton \& White, in contrast to the “greater”
cardamom is Amomum subulatum (that he discusses on p.\,65) that is commonly 
used
as an inferior substitute for E. cardamomum. \citet[467\,f]{sing-1972} provided an
interesting discussion of \emph{hareṇu}, noting that the term refers to two
substances, first the \emph{satīna} pulse (Pisum sativum, Linn.), and second an
unknown fruit such as perhaps a Vitex. They noted, “None of the text commentators
have attempted to disclose the nature of its source plant,” although Ḍalhaṇa
described it as aromatic and identical to \emph{reṇukā} (SS.ci.2.75).%
% Sanskrit: {hareṇu}, Latin: {Amomum subulatum, Roxb.?}, References: {PVS
%Caraka 2.734, AVS 1.128, NK #154} %
}

\item[24] 

Over a fire, one should cook the \se{yakṛt}{liver} of a \se{godhā}{monitor lizard} 
prepared
with \se{antra}{entrails} and stuffed with \se{māgadhi}{long pepper}.  As is well 
known, \se{yakṛt}{liver} which is \se{niṣevita}{used} with collyrium certainly 
destroys night blindness.


\item [25] 

After preparing both a \se{plīhan}{spleen} and a liver on a spit, one should eat them
both with ghee and oil.\footnote{We read the locative as if an instrumental; if the
locative were intended then it would be the spit that would be coated with oil and
ghee.}

\item [25cd--26ab]

As is well known, there are  six diseases that can be \se{yāpya}{alleviated};
\se{tatra}{in those cases} one should release the blood by bloodletting.

And for the sake of wellbeing one should also purge using aged ghee 
\se{upahita}{combined} with 
purgative \se{aṅga}{aids}. 

\item[26cd--27]

When an eye-disease is \se{pavanodbhava}{caused by wind} they say that
\se{pañcāṅgulataila}{castor oil} mixed with milk is good.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa says
that the unexpressed topic of this recipe is \se{timira}{partial blindness}.} In
the case of diseases of \se{śonita}{blood} and \se{pitta}{bile}, one should drink
ghee with the three fruits; it is particularly
cleansing.\footnote{\se{śonita-pitta, rakta-pitta}{Blood-bile} is a
widely-recognized disease in ayurveda, but the compound here is definitely dual,
which rules out that interpretation. One would expect blood-bile because the
previous verse } In the case of phlegm, a purgative by means of
\se{trivṛt}{turpeth} is recommended. In the case of all three humours,
\se{sugandhi}{sandal} in oil is prepared with it (turpeth).\footnote{The expression 
“\se{tailasugandhi}{the fragrant one in oil}” is puzzling. The word \emph{sugandhi} 
has different referents in the \emph{Nighaṇṭu} literature but is not common as a 
noun in the extant literature. “Sandal” is just one of its possible meanings.}
% Ḍalhaṇa (commentary on SS.ci.24.7) equates  
%\emph{trivarga}, i.e., \emph{triphalā}, with \emph{trisugandhi}.

\item[28]

In cases of \se{timira}{partial blindness}, aged ghee is recommended.  It is good if 
it is kept in an iron vessel.

\item [28cd--29ab]

One should know that ghee with the three mylobalans is always good, and it is made
with what is called \se{meṣaviṣāṇa}{periploca of the woods}.

A man who is suffering from partial blindess should lick the finely-ground three fruits 
mixed with ghee \se{sapāṇa}{off his hand}.\footnote{“Off his hand” translates the 
adverbial \emph{sapāṇam}, an unusual word. Ḍalhaṇa reproduces a reading close 
to the Nepalese recention but says that Jejjaṭa rejects it and so he also does 
\citep[627]{susr-trikamji3}.}

\item[29cd]

Alternatively, someone afflicted by phlegm should apply them (the three fruits)
mixed with oil and \se{pragāḍha}{steeped} in honey.

\item[30]

The very best oil, well-cooked with a decoction of cow-dung, is good in cases of 
partial blindness, taken as an errhine.

In cases caused by bile, ghee by itself is good, as is oil when it arises from wind and 
blood.
