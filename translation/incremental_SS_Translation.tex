        The \href{http://sushrutaproject.org}{Suśruta Project} is producing 
        \href{https://saktumiva.org/wiki/wujastyk/susrutasamhita/01-su.su/provisional-edition_sutrasthana}{a
         new Sanskrit text edition} of the 
        \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} based on the early Nepalese manuscripts.  As we 
        gradually transcribe 
        and edit the manuscripts, we are producing this new translation of the classic 
        work.

\begin{itemize}
    \item [1]
    Now I shall narrate the chapter on the origin of this knowledge.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa 
    understands the word "\saneng{veda}{knowledge}" as specifically "medical knowledge."  
    He says that the word "longevity" (\emph{āyur}) \ssaneng{āyur}{life, longevity}
     has been elided.}
    
%    Notes Dec 8:
%    Dominik: N's ādhyāyaṃ corruption of H's nāmādhyāyaṃ: possible evidence that N was created 
%after H
%    Check: Ācārya 1931 footnote on vedotpattim
%    Commentary Ḍalhaṇa (c. 1200 CE) notes āyur dropped from veda in vedotpattim
%    
    
    \item[2]\footnote{At this point, later manuscripts and commentaries include the 
    statement "as the venerable Dhanvantari stated."  The absence of this statement in the 
    early Nepalese MSS is noteworthy. See the discussion of \cite{kleb-2021b}.}
%     <!-- Notes Dec 8:
%    Dom: note the omission of Dhanvantari, which is in the edition.
%    On Dhanvantari, see Meulenbeld HIM, authorities associated with Suśruta. He's an authority on 
%surgery or toxicology-->
    
    \item[3] Now, as is well-known, Aupadhenava, Vaitaraṇa, Aurabhra, Puṣkalāvata,
Karavīra, Gopurarakṣita, Bhoja, Suśruta and others addressed Lord Divodāsa,
king of Kāśi, the best of the immortals, who was in his ashram surrounded by
an entourage of sages.\footnote{On these persons, see \cite[IA
369\,ff.]{meul-hist}. \citet{kleb-2021a} has discussed these authors in the
context of an anonymous commentary on the \SS\ that cites them.}

%    Notes Dec 8:
%    Dom: Check these names in Meulenbeld 
%    Bhoja is an early lost authority on medicine. Not the same person as King Bhoja, commentator 
%on the Yogasūtras.
%    Ḍalhaṇa's comm. mentions Bhoja as also included in prabhṛtayaḥ: so the version of the text he 
%was using did not mention Bhoja, but he was aware of him: His provenance makes it possible that 
%he knew the Nepalese version of the SŚ
    
    \item[4]
%O Lord, after seeing people who are assailed by the impingements of various pains 
%caused by 
%physical, mental and accidental diseases, who have the support of friends [but] 
%feeling as if they 
%were alone, and acting frantically, shouting out, we have been distressed. 

“O Lord, distress arose in our minds after witnessing people thrashing about with
cries, assailed by different kinds of \saneng{vedanābhighāta}{pain and injury}, 
feeling helpless in spite 
of having friends, because of diseases arising from the body, the mind and
external sources.


    
%    Notes Dec 8:
%    āgantu - caused by something from outside the body
%    abhighāta - threats, impingements 
%    vedanābhighāta - tatpuruṣa 
%    anātha - among a list of people who shouldn't be treated.

“To quell the illnesses of those who seek happiness and for our own purpose of
prolonging life, we desire \saneng{āyurveda}{the science of life} that is being
taught.  Welfare\ssaneng{śreyas}{welfare}, both in this world and in
    the next, depends upon it. Therefore, we have come to the Lord in pupillage." %

\item[5] The Lord said to them:

“Welcome to you!  My children, all of you are beyond reproach and worthy 
to be taught.
   
    
    \item[6] 
%    "As is well-known in this world, before creating people, Brahmā composed 
%    what is called Āyurveda.\footnote{The relative pronoun \emph{yad}, that has 
%no  
%    correlative \citep[\P 461]{spei-1886}, is omitted.} 
%    It is taught as part of the \emph{Atharvaveda}, in hundreds of 
%    thousands of verses and a thousand chapters and, after observing the short 
%    lifespan and low intelligence of people, made it again in eight parts.

%    
    
    “As is well known, Ayurveda is the name of what is said to be the subsidiary
part of the Atharvaveda.   Before creating people, Svayambhū composed it in
hundreds of thousands of verses and a thousand chapters and, after observing the
short lifespan and low intelligence of people, he presented it again in eight
parts.\footnote{Svayambhū is another name for Brahmā, the creator.}
    
    \item[7] Surgery, treatment of body parts above the clavicle, general medicine, 
    knowledge of spirits, care of children, and the disciplines of antidotes, rejuvenation 
    and aphrodisiacs.
    % why do some of the auxiliaries end in tantra? Dom: Some were disciplines that had a separate life outside āyurveda. The others were more particular to vaidyas.
        \item[8.1a] Now,  a collection of the characteristics of each component of Āyurveda.
        
        \item[8.1b] Among them, [the component] called surgery has the goal of extracting various grasses, wood, stone, dust, iron (?), soil, bone, hair, nails, discharge of pus, malignant wounds and foreign bodies inside the womb, and of determining the application of surgical instruments, knives, caustics and fire by means of sixty definitions.
        %Ḍalhaṇa seems to read duṣṭavraṇāntar, and glosses antar as madhyāt. He then reads garbhaśalya (HIM - foetuses stuck in the womb). Ḍalhaṇa is aware of the reading ṣaṣṭyā vidhānaiḥ (following uddhraṇārtha), and says some explain it as apatarpaṇādyai rakṣāvidhānāntair dvivraṇīyoktair ity arthaḥ. However, mss. 699 and 533 read abhi° not vi°
        
        \item[8.2] [The component] named the doctrine of treating body parts above 
        the clavicles has the aim of curing diseases situated above clavicles that is,  
        diseases located in ears, eyes, mouth, nose and so on.
        
        \item[8.3] [The component] called general medicine has the goal of curing illnesses established in the whole body and [diseases] such as fever, tumour, swelling, hemorrhagic disorders, insanity, epilepsy, urinary diseases, diarrhoea and the like.
        
        \item[8.4] [The component] called knowledge of spirits is for appeasing
demons by pacification rites and making food offerings for those whose
minds have been possessed by gods, their enemies,\footnote{Dānavas.  The
insertion marks (\emph{kākapada}s) below the text at this point appears to
be by the original scribe.} Gandharvas, Yakṣas, demons, deceased
ancestors, Piśācas, Vināyakas, \footnote{The vulgate doesn't have
\emph{vināyaka}s but does add \emph{asura}s, probably under the influence
of Ḍalhaṇa.  Cite Paul Courtright, Ganesha book.} Nāgas and evil spirits
that possess children. % Notes: vināyaka is omitted from the vulgate. In
% Mahābhārata, etc. It refers to
%a class of demons.-->
        
        
        
        \item[8.5] [The component] called care of children is for bearing children and purifying defects in a wet-nurse's milk, and curing diseases that have arisen from bad breast milk and demons.
        
        \item[8.6] [The component] called the discipline of toxicology is for
[knowing] the signs of poison from snake and insect bites and for
neutralising various combinations of poisons.\footnote{The scribal
insertion marks (crosses) above the line at this point in MS K appear to
be in a later hand and their referent is lost in the damaged part of the
folio.  Although MSS N and H include \saneng{lūtā}{spiders} and
\saneng{sarīsṛpa}{creepy-crawlies} in the list, it does seem that MS K had
a shorter list, and the vulgate edition adds \saneng{mūṣika}{rodents}.}
        
        \item[8.7] [The component] called he discipline of rejuvenation is maintaining youth, bringing about a long life and mental vigour and for curing diseases.
        
        % Got to here 2021-01-13
        
        \item[8.8] [The component] called the discipline of aphrodisiacs brings about the increase, purity, accumulation and  production of semen for those whose semen is minimal, bad, depleted, and dry [respectively] and for inducing an erection.
        
        \item[9] Thus, this Āyurveda is taught with eight components."\\ 
        
        "Among these [components], tell us which [component is taught] to whom."
        
        \item[10] They said, "After you have sufficiently conveyed the knowledge of surgery, teach us everything."
        
        \item[11] He said, "so be it."
        
        \item[12] They then said, "Having considered the view of all of us, when we are unanimous, Suśruta will question you. We too will learn what is being taught to him."
        
        \item[13] He said, "so be it.
        
        \item[14–16] Now, as is well-known, the aim of Āyurveda is eliminating the diseases of the sick and supporting the healthy.  Āyurveda is that in which they know life, or that by which life is known. Learn the best component of it, which is being taught in accordance with tradition, perception, inference and analogy.
        
        \item[17] Indeed, this component is first and foremost as afore-mentioned because it cures wounds and joining together Yajña's head and pradhāna (?). For, just as it has been formerly said,  'the head that had been cut off by Rudra was joined again by the two Aśvins.'
    
    
    

  
    
    
    
    
    \item [28] Thus, living creatures and their strength,
\saneng{varṇa}{complexion} and \saneng{ojas}{energy} are rooted in food.  That
(food) depends on the six \saneng{rasa}{flavours}. Thus, the flavours depend
on \saneng{dravya}{substance}, and substances depend on medicinal herbs. 
There are two kinds of them (herbs):  stationary and mobile.\footnote{Suśruta
sū.1.28 \cite[I, 21]{shar-susr}, \cite[7]{susr-trikamji2004}.}
