        \section{The Manuscripts used in the Vulgate editions by 
        Yādavaśarma Trivikrama Ācārya}
    
        Yādavaśarma Trivikrama Ācārya produced three successive editions of the \SS\ 
        with the commentary of Ḍalhaṇa, in 1915, 1931 and 1938.  These editions, 
        especially the last, are considered the most scholarly and reliable editions of the 
        work, and have been constantly reprinted up to the present day.
        
        The 1915 edition was based on three manuscripts.  The 1931 edition used 
        another nine.  For his final 1938 edition, Ācārya used a further 
        three.\footnote{\cite[22]{susr-trikamji3}.}
        
        \subsection{The manuscripts of the 1915 edition}
        
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item[1] Calcutta, Royal Asiatic Society.  Covers the sūtra, nidāna, śārīra and 
            kalpa sthānas.  
            
            \item [2] Jaipur, Pandit Gaṅgādharabhaṭṭaśarman, lecturer at the Royal 
            Sanskrit University.  Covers the cikitsāsthānna and the uttaratantra.
            
            \item [3]  Bundi, my great friend the royal physician Paṃ.\ Śrīprasādaśarman  
            Covers the uttaratantra.
        \end{enumerate}
        
        \subsection{The manuscripts of the 1931 edition}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item[1] Vārāṇasī, professor of literature, the great Gaurīnāthapāṭhaka.  With the 
    \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}. Covers the nidānasthāna and uttaratantra.
    
    \item [2]  Ahmedabad.  My friend Sva.\ Vā.\ Vaidya Raṇachoḍalāla Motīlālaśarman.  
    With the \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}.  Covers the śārīrasthāna.
    
    \item [3] From the library of my great friend Sva.\ Vā.\ Vaidya Murārajīśarman.  
    Extremely old. No commentary.  Covers the śārīrasthāna. 
    
    \item [4]  Puṇe, BORI library.  With the \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}. Covers the
śārīrasthāna.\footnote{Not one of the three MSS of the
\emph{śārīrasthāna}described in \cite{shar-vaid}.}
    
    \item [5]  Puṇe, BORI library.  With the \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}. Complete.  
    With some damaged folia.
    
    \item [6]  Bombay, Asiatic Society.  Incomplete.\footnote{Possibly \MScite{Mumbai, 
    AS B.I.3} or \MScite{Mumbai, AS B.D.109} \citep[v.\,1, \# 212 and 
    213]{vela-1930}.  But both these have the \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}.  The first 
    covers only the śārīrasthāna; the second may be complete, but Velankar calls it 
    only “disorderly.”}
    
    \item [7]

    \item[1] Now I shall narrate the chapter on the origin of this
knowledge.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa understood the word "\saneng{veda}{knowledge}" as
specifically "medical knowledge." He said that the word "longevity"
(\emph{āyur}) \ssaneng{āyur}{life, longevity} had been elided.

%    Notes Dec 8:
%    Dominik: N's ādhyāyaṃ corruption of H's nāmādhyāyaṃ: possible evidence that N was created 
%after H

%    Commentary Ḍalhaṇa (c. 1200 CE) notes āyur dropped from veda in vedotpattim
%    
%    
After this opening statement, later manuscripts and commentaries include
the attribution, "as the venerable Dhanvantari stated."  The absence of this
statement in the early Nepalese MSS is highly noteworthy because it removes
the outer narrative frame of the \SS\
\parencites[148]{wuja-2013}[\S\,3.1.2]{kleb-2021b}.  On the figure of Dhanvatari in 
medical literature, see \cite[IA 358--361]{meul-hist}.} %     <!-- Notes Dec 8:

    \item[2] Now, as is well-known, Aupadhenava, Vaitaraṇa, Aurabhra, Puṣkalāvata,
Karavīra, Gopurarakṣita, Bhoja, Suśruta and others addressed Lord Divodāsa,
king of Kāśi, the best of the immortals, who was in his ashram surrounded by
an entourage of sages.\footnote{On these persons, see \cite[IA
361--363, 369\,ff.]{meul-hist}. The authority Bhoja does not appear in the list as
published in the vulgate edition \citep[1]{susr-trikamji2}, and was not
included in \cite{meul-hist} amongst “authorities mentioned in the \SS.” 
\citeauthor{meul-hist} gathered textual evidence about Bhoja at \cite[IA
690--691]{meul-hist}. \citet{kleb-2021a} has discussed these authors in the
context of an anonymous commentary on the \SS\ that cites them.}

%on the Yogasūtras.

%was using did not mention Bhoja, but he was aware of him: His provenance makes it possible that

        \item[28] In this context, as far as this discipline is concerned, a 
        \saneng{puruṣa}{human being} is called an amalgam of the five elements 
        and the embodied soul.  This is where \saneng{kriyā}{procedures} apply. This 
        is the locus. 
        
        Why?
        
        Because of the duality of the world, the world is twofold: the stationary
and the moving. Its \saneng{ātmaka}{nature} is twofold, depending on the
preponderance of Agni and Soma.\footcite[See][]{wuja-2004}  Alternatively,
it can be considered as being fivefold.  The multitude of beings in it are
fourfold: they are termed “sweat-born, stone-born, caul-born and
egg-born”.\footnote{This fourfold classification of beings is paralleled
with closely-related vocabulary in  \emph{Bhelasaṃhitā} 4.4.4	
\parencites[206]{kris-2000}[81]{mook-1921}.}  Where they are concerned, the
human being is the main thing; others are his support.  Therefore, the
\saneng{puruṣa}{human being} is the locus.

\item[29]  Diseases are said to be the conjunction of the person and 
\saneng{duḥkha}{suffering}.
 There are four of them: invasive, bodily, mental and inherent.  The invasive ones 
 are caused by an injury.  The bodily ones are based on food, caused by 
 \saneng{vaiṣamya}{irregularities} in wind, bile, phlegm and blood.\footnote{Note 
 that four humoral substances are assumed here.} 
 
The \saneng{mānasa}{mental} ones, caused by 
\saneng{icchā}{desire} and 
\saneng{dveṣa}{hatred}, 
include:  
\saneng{krodha}{anger}, 
\saneng{āśoka}{grief}, 
\saneng{dainya}{misery}, 
\saneng{harṣa}{overexcitement}, 
 \saneng{kāma}{lust}, 
 \saneng{viṣāda}{depression},
 \saneng{īrṣyā}{envy},
 \saneng{asūyā}{jealousy},
 \saneng{mātsarya}{malice}, 
 and
 \saneng{lobha}{greed}.
 
 The \saneng{svābhāvika}{inherent} ones are hunger, thirst, old age, death, 
 sleep and  those of the \saneng{prakṛti}{temperament}.
 
 These too are \saneng{adhiṣṭhāna}{located} in the mind and body.
 
\saneng{lekhana}{Scarification},
\saneng{bṛṃhaṇa}{nourishment},
\saneng{saṃśodhana}{purification},
 \saneng{saṃśamana}{pacification},
 \saneng{āhāra}{diet} and
 \saneng{ācāra}{regimen}, 
 properly employed, bring about their cure.
    
 
 \item [30] Furthermore, food is the  \saneng{mūla}{root} of living beings as well
as of \saneng{bala}{strength}, \saneng{varṇa}{complexion} and 
\saneng{ojas}{vital
    energy}. It \saneng{āyatta}{depends on} the six \saneng{rasa}{flavours}.
Flavours, furthermore, have substances as their \saneng{āśrayin}{substrate}.  And
substances are \saneng{oṣadhī-}{remedies}.\footnote{Pāṇini 6.3.132 provides that
the final vowel of the noun \emph{oṣadhi} may be lengthened
(\emph{$\rightarrow$oṣadhī}) under certain conditions.  These conditions require
that the word be used in a Vedic mantra and not in the nominative.  Neither
condition is met in this passage, yet the author uses the form \emph{oṣadhī}. 
This form is in fact not uncommon in medical literature as well as in epics,
purāṇas, smṛtis, and other parts of Sanskrit literature.} There are 
two types:
\saneng{sthāvara}{stationary} and \saneng{jaṅgama}{moving}.



\item [31]  Of these, there are four types of stationary ones:
\saneng{vanaspati}{fruit trees}, \saneng{vṛkṣa}{flowering trees},
\saneng{oṣadhi}{herbs} and \saneng{vīrudh}{shrubs}.\footnote{Ca.sū.1.71--72 
also
describes these four types of medicinal plant in similar terms but with slightly
differing names: \emph{oṣadhi} is a plant that ends after fruiting, \emph{vīrudh}
is a plant that branches out, \emph{vanaspati} is a tree with fruit, and
\emph{vānaspatya} is a tree with fruit and flowers.}
Amongst these, the “fruit trees” have fruit but no flowers.\footnote{The MSS agree 
in reading \emph{phalavantyaḥ} “having flowers” which is grammatically 
non-standard. This form is also found in the  \emph{Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa} 
(1.92.27, \cite[1.92.27][56r]{sarm-1912}).}  The “flowering trees” 
have flowers and fruit.  The “herbs” die when the fruit is ripe. “Shrubs” put out 
shoots.

% \citep{ober-2003} didn't have anything on phalavantyo that I could find quickly.


   \item[32]  As is well known, moving remedies are also of four types: those
\saneng{jarāyuja}{born in in a caul}, those \saneng{aṇḍaja}{born from eggs},
those \saneng{svedaja}{born of sweat}, and \saneng{udbhid}{shoots}. Amongst
these, those born in a caul include \saneng{paśu}{animals}, humans, and
\saneng{vyāla}{wild animals}.  Birds, \saneng{sarīsṛpa}{creepy-crawlies} and
snakes are “born of eggs.” \saneng{kṛmi}{Worms}, \saneng{kunta}{small insects}
and \saneng{pipīlika}{ants} and others are born of sweat.\footnote{The word
\emph{kunta}, though marked as “lexical” in most dictionaries, is in fact found
in literature, commonly as a compound with \emph{pipīlika}; the compound
sometimes seems to be understood a type of ant (\emph{tatpuruṣa} compound)
rather than as a pair of insects (\emph{dvandva} compound).}  Shoots include
\saneng{indragopa}{red velvet mites} and \saneng{maṇḍūka}{frogs}.\footnote{On
\emph{indragopa}, see \cite{lien-1978}.}|

\item[33] In this context, among the stationary remedies, 
\saneng{tvak}{skin}, 
\saneng{patra}{leaves}, 
\saneng{puṣpa}{flowers}, 
\saneng{phala}{fruits},
\saneng{mūla}{roots},
\saneng{kanda}{bulbs},
\saneng{kṣīra}{sap},
\saneng{niryāsa}{resin},
\saneng{sāra}{essence},
\saneng{sneha}{oil}, 
and
\saneng{svarasa}{juice extract}\footnote{On \saneng{svarasa}{juice extract} see
CS 1.1.73, 1.4.7; \VN{4.10.12}{}.} 
are useful; among the moving remedies 
\saneng{carman}{pelt}, hair, nails, and 
\saneng{rudhira}{blood} and so forth. 

 \item[34] And \saneng{pārthiva}{earthen products} include gold and 
 silver.\footnote{The flow of concepts in the treatise seems to be interrupted here.}
 
\item[35] The \saneng{kālakṛta}{items created by time} are \saneng{samplava}{clusters} 
as far as wind and \saneng{nivāta}{no wind}, heat and shade, darkness and light
and the cold, hot and \saneng{varṣā}{rainy seasons} are concerned. 
The divisions of time are the
\saneng{nimeṣa}{blink of the eye}, a
\saneng{kāṣṭhā}{trice}, 
\saneng{kalā}{minutes}, 
\saneng{muhūrta}{three-quarters of an hour}, a
\saneng{ahorātra}{day and night}, a
\saneng{pakṣa}{fortnight}, a
\saneng{māsa}{month}, a
\saneng{ṛtu}{season}, a
\saneng{ayana}{half-year}, a
\saneng{saṃvatsara}{year},
and
\saneng{yuga}{yuga}.\footnote{These units are presented at 
\VN{1.6.5}{} and discussed by \citet[\S\,59]{haya-2017}.}


\item[36]  These naturally cause 
\saneng{sañcaya}{accumulation}, 
\saneng{prakopa}{irritation}, 
\saneng{upaśama}{pacification} 
and 
\saneng{pratīkāra}{alleviation} of the \saneng{doṣa}{humours}. And they have
    \saneng{prayojanavat}{practical purposes}.
    
[There are verses on this:]\footnote{See footnote \ref{bha}.}

\item[38] 
This fourfold category is taught by physicians as a cause for the agitation and 
quelling of bodily diseases.%
%
\footnote{On the topic of the “group of four,” the commentator Ḍalhaṇa
considers them to be “food, behaviour, earthen products and items created by
time.”  He refers to the author of the lost commentary entitled \emph{Pañjikā},
and to Jejjaṭa \citep[IA, 372--3, 192]{meul-hist}.  In his view, these early
commentators  do not agree that the \saneng{caturvarga}{fourfold grouping} refers
to the quartet of \saneng{sthāvara}{stationary}, \saneng{jaṅgama}{moving},
\saneng{pārthiva}{earthen products} and \saneng{kālakṛta}{items created by 
time} \citep[9a]{susr-trikamji2004}.}

\item[39] There are two kinds of invasive diseases. Some certainly 
\saneng{nipat-}{affect} the mind, 
others the body.\footnote{The text uses an archaic expletive here, \emph{ha}.} 
Their \saneng{kriyā}{treatment} is of two kinds too. 

\item[40] For those that affect the body there is \saneng{śārīravad}{physical} 
therapy, whereas for those that affect the mind there is the 
\saneng{varga}{collection} of desirable sensory experiences like sound that 
bring \saneng{sukha }{comfort}.


Those that affect the body have therapy that is  
\saneng{śārīravat}{physical}, whereas for those of the mind it is 
 

\item [41] 

\saneng{evam}{Along these lines}, this brief explanation of the 
\se{catuṣtaya}{four factors}
is given: 
\saneng{puruṣa}{human being},
\saneng{vyadhi}{disease},
\saneng{oṣadhi}{remedies},
\saneng{kriyākāla}{the time for therapies}.

In that context, from the mention of the word “human,” the collection of 
substances that arise from it, such as the elements, and the particulars of its major 
and minor \saneng{aṅga}{parts} such as 
\let\se\saneng
\se{tvak}{skin}, 
\se{māṃsa}{flesh}, 
\se{sirā}{ducts}, 
\se{snāyu}{sinews}, 
\se{asthi}{bones} and 
\se{sandhi}{joints}
are meant.
 
From the mention of diseases, all diseases 
caused by
wind, bile, phlegm,
\se{sannipāta}{congested humours},
\se{āgantu}{external factors} and 
\se{svabhāva}{inherent factors} are \se{vyākhyāta}{intended}.

From the mention of remedies, 
 there is the teaching of 
 substances,
 tastes, 
 potencies,
 post-digestive tastes.
 
From the mention of 
\se{kriyā}{procedure}, 
\se{karman}{therapies} such as oiling
and 
\se{chedya}{excision} are taught.

From the mention of the word time, every single teaching about the times for
procedures is meant.

    \item [1] Thus, living creatures and their strength,
\saneng{varṇa}{complexion} and \saneng{ojas}{energy} are rooted in food.  That
(food) depends on the six \saneng{rasa}{flavours}. Thus, the flavours depend
on \saneng{dravya}{substance}, and substances depend on medicinal herbs. 
There are two kinds of them (herbs):  stationary and mobile.\footnote{\VN{1.1.28}{} \cite[I,
