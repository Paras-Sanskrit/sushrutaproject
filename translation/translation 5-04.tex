\section{Kalpasthāna, adhyāya 4}

\subsection{Introduction}
The fourth chapter of the Kalpasthāna of the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} addresses 
the topic of snake bites and snake venom.  Unusually for the Nepalese version of 
the \SS, the discussion is framed as a question from Suśruta to the wise 
Dhanvantari.  Suśruta's questions are about the number of snakes, how they 
are classified, the symptoms of their bites and the pulses or stages of poisoning 
experienced by a victim of snakebite and related topics.  The taxonomy of snakes 
is presented in a presentational variant form in Figure~\ref{snakes}.


    
\subsection{Literature}
A brief survey of this chapter's contents and a detailed assessment of the
existing research on it to 2002 was provided by Meulenbeld.\footcite[IA,
292--294]{meul-hist}. 
%Translations of this chapter since 2000 have appeared by 
%\textcites[131--139]{wuja-2003}[3, 1--15]{shar-1999}{srik-2002}.\footnote{For a 
%    bibliography of translations to 2002, including Latin (1847), English (1877), 
%Gujarati (1963) 
%    and Japanese (1971), see \cite[IB, 314--315]{meul-hist}.}
    
A discussion of this chapter specifically in the light of the Nepalese
manuscripts was published by Harimoto.\footcite[101--104]{hari-2011} After a
close comparative reading of lists of poisonous snakes, Harimoto concluded
that, “the Nepalese version is internally consistent while the [vulgate]
editions are not.”  Harimoto showed how the vulgate editions had been
adjusted textually to smooth over inconsistencies, and gave insights into
these editorial processes.\footnote{The two editions that Harimoto noted,
    \cite{vulgate} and \cite{bhat-1889}, present identical texts.}

    \item[1] Now we shall explain the procedure\q{kalpa?} about the knowlege 
    concerning the venom in those who have been bitten by snakes. 
    
    \item[3] Suśruta, grasping his feet, questions the wise Dhanvantari, who was 
    expert in all the sciences.
    
    \item[4]
    
    My Lord, you are capable of speaking about the number of snakes, and their 
    divisions, the signs of a bite, and the knowledge concerning the 
    \se{vega}{pulses} of poison.\footnote{The word “pulse” translates \dev{vega}, 
    which is other contexts may mean “(natural) urge.”  Here, it is rather the 
    discrete stages or phases of physiological reaction to envenomation.}
        
    \item[5]
    
    On hearing his query, that special physician spoke.
    
    “The snakes such as Vāsukī and Takṣaka are uncountable, O great 
    one.\q{reading mahātmānā(ḥ) as voc pl.\ of respect.}
    
\item[6--9ab]

“They are snake-lords who support the earth, as bright as the ritual fire,
ceaselessly roaring, raining and burning. They hold up the earth, with its
oceans, mountains and continents. If they are angered, they can destroy the whole 
world with a breath or a look.  Honour to them. They have no role here in medicine. 

The ones that I shall enumerate in sequence are those mundane ones with
poison in their fangs who bite humans.\footnote{The next few verses are
    discussed in detail by \citet[101--104]{hari-2011}, who shows that in the
    taxonomy of snakes, the Nepalese version of the \SS\ has greater internal
    coherence than the vulgate recension.}

\item[9cd--10]    

“There are eighty kinds of snakes and they are divided in five ways:
Darvīkaras, Maṇḍalins, Rājimants, and Nirviṣās.  And Karañjas that are
traditionally of three kinds.\footnote{\citet{hari-2011} translates these
    names as “hooded,” “spotted,” “striped,” “harmless,” and “hybrid.”}
