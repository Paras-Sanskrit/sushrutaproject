\subsection{Translation}

\begin{translation}
 \item[1--2]  And now I shall explain the procedures for safeguarding food and drink, as
 were declared by the Venerable Dhanvantari.\footnote{MS H adds in the margin \dev{atha 
 khalu vatsa suśrutaḥ} “Now 
 begins Vatsa Suśruta.” \emph{Vatsa} can be a term of 
 endearment, “sonny,” or the name of an ancient lineage, but not one usually associated with 
 Suśruta.  The mention of Dhanvantari here is the only time in the Nepalese recension that 
 this authority is cited as the source of Ayurvedic teaching.  See the discussion by 
 \citet[28--32]{kleb-2021b}, who concludes that the earliest recoverable recension of the \SS\ 
 may have had the phrase only at this point and not elsewhere in the work.}
 
 \item[3]
 

 Divodāsa, the king of the earth, was the foremost supporter of religious
discipline and virtue. He gave his unblemished instruction to his students, of
whom Suśruta was the first.\footnote{This is a quite different statement from the vulgate 
\citep[559]{susr-trikamji3} that has Dhanvantari as the teacher, and calls him the 
\se{kāśipati}{Lord of Kāśī}.  Ḍalhaṇa followed the vulgate but explicitly noted the reading 
before us with small differences: \dev{divodāsaḥ kṣitipatistapodharmaśrutākaraḥ} 
“Divodāsa, 
the king of the earth, was a mine of traditions about discipline and virtue.”}

\subsection{[Threats to the king]}

\item[4]  

A king, unknowing, may be assailed with poisons by evil-hearted enemies who have plucked 
up their courage, or by his own people who have been seduced away, wishing to pour the 
poison of their anger into any chink they can find.\footnote{Verses about the use of 
Venemous Virgins as a weapon do not appear in the Nepalese manuscripts. Cf.\ \cite[81\,f., 
132]{wuja-2003}}

%A king may be cunningly assailed with poisons by evil-hearted enemies who
%have plucked up their courage, or even by his own people turned traitor,
%wishing to pour the poison of their anger into any chink they can find. Or
%sometimes by women using various concoctions, hoping to make him love
%them.\footnote{On how women of ill-character mix their nail-clippings or
%menstrual blood, etc.\ with the king's food, see
%p.\,\pageref{dusyodara}.} Or again, if a Venomous Virgin is used, a man can
%lose his life instantly.\label{visakanya}

%% Virgin', see p.\,\pageref{intro:visakanya}.}
