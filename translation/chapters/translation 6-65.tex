% \citet{sche-term} discussed the term \emph{yukti} in Buddhist
%literature; see also \cite[444--446]{biar-1964} \cite[343--345]{pret-1991}, while

\cite{frau-1958} discussed the influence of the \emph{tantrayukti}s in the Sāṅkhya tradition.
\citet[105--106, fn.\,109]{prei-2013} provided further references to the
discussion of \emph{yukti} in Buddhist literatures. \citet{mane-2008}
gave examples of the use of tantrayuktis in Buddhist commentarial
literature. \citet{chev-2009} discusses the translation of the \emph{tantrayukti}s in Tamil literary tradition, with a specific focus on \emph{Tolkāppiyam} and its commentaries.

\section{Early Sources}

An ancient tradition of enumerating the \emph{tantrayukti}s served as a 
foundational source not only for medical texts but also for works in various other 
disciplines, including Arthaśāstra, philosophy, and even grammar. The \SS\  stands 
as the earliest Āyurvedic text that presents a compilation of a list of 
\emph{tantrayukti}s followed by their definitions and usage. Mentions to 
Tantrayuktis are also found in the \CS\  \Ca{8.12}{} which introduce four additional 
\emph{tantrayukti}s. However, the \emph{tantrayukti}s remain undefined in the 
\CS. 

The enumeration and definitions of the \emph{tantrayukti}s in the 
\SS\  closely parallel their treatment in the \emph{Arthaśāstra}. 
\emph{Tantrayukti}s are discussed in the fifteenth and final chapter of the 
\emph{Arthaśāstra}, called the 
\emph{Tantrayukti}.\footnote{\cite[280--283]{kang-1960}} For a side-by-side 
comparison of the \emph{tantrayukti}s in the \SS\ and the \emph{Arthaśāstra}, 
please refer to Table \ref{table-SAV}.

\emph{Yuktidīpikā} (circa late sixth to early eighth century), an anonymous 
commentary on Īśvarakṛṣṇa's \emph{Sāṅkhyakārikā}, initiates its discourse with a 
detailed discussion of the characteristics of a scientific treatise, some of which align 
with the \emph{tantrayukti}s.\footnote{See \cite[605--614]{ober-1968} for a 
detailed discussion of the use of the \emph{tantrayukti}s in the 
\emph{Yuktidīpikā}.} 
In the \emph{Yuktidīpikā}, these terms are referred to as \emph{tantraguṇa} or \emph{tantrasampat}. They are: (1) \emph{sūtropapatti} (2) \emph{pramāṇopapatti} (3) \emph{avayavopapatti} (4) \emph{anyūnatā} (5) \emph{saṃśayokti} (6) \emph{nirṇayokti} (7) \emph{uddeśa} (8) \emph{nirdeśa} (9) \emph{anukrama} (10) \emph{saṃjñā} and (11) \emph{upadeśa}.\footnote{

		uddeśanirdeśamanukramaśca saṃjñopadeśāviha tantrasampat//\\}
	\end{verse}
\cite[3]{wezl-1998}} 

Discussions on the \emph{tantrayukti}s are also found in Tamil technical literature, the earliest of which is the \emph{Tolkāppiyam}.\footnote{For a detailed discussion of the treatment of the \emph{tantrayukti}s in the \emph{Tolkāppiyam} see \cite{chev-2009}.} 
A list of 32 \emph{tantrayukti}s, called \emph{utti} or \emph{tantiravutti} in Tamil, are given in the 27\textsuperscript{th} (the final) chapter titled \emph{Marapiyal} “Chapter on conventions” of the last book called \emph{Poruḷ} “Matters” of the \emph{Tolkāppiyam}. There is no consensus regarding the dating of the \emph{Tolkāppiyam}. However, if we endorse Zvelebil's view, which posits that the final redaction of the \emph{Tolkāppiyam} occurred around the fifth century AD, it follows that this section of the \emph{Tolkappiyam} cannot postdate the fifth century. If we follow the dating of Zvelebil, we can safely argue that by that time, Sanskrit \emph{tantrayukti}s had already been translated into Tamil. Nevertheless, determining the correspondence between specific \emph{tantrayukti}s and Tamil \emph{utti}s poses a challenge. A major factor contributing to this challenge is the disagreement between two commentators of the \emph{Tolkāppiyam}, namely Iḷampūraṇar (11th or 12th century) and Pērāciriyar (possibly 13th century), regarding the interpretation of the list of \emph{utti}s. It is still not clear which list of 32 \emph{tantrayukti}s was before the author of the \emph{Tolkāppiyam}. 

After the \emph{Tolkāppiyam}, several other Tamil texts refer to the \emph{tantrayukti}s. Among them the \emph{Yāpparuṅkalam} (possibly 10th century), the \emph{Vīracoḻiyam} (11th century), \emph{Naṉṉūl} (late 12th or early 13th century), and their commentaries hold significant importance in this context.

The third book of the \emph{Viṣṇudharmattarapurāṇa}, believed to have
been composed between the fifth and seventh centuries, includes a chapter
dedicated to the \emph{tantrayukti}s.\footnote{Adhyāya 6,
    \cite[13--14]{shah-1958}.} Unlike the \emph{Arthaśāstra} and the \SS,
    this chapter lacks illustrative examples of the \emph{tantrayukti}s. The
    chapter lists 32 \emph{tantrayukti}s followed by definitions. Notably,
    the list and definitions given here -- we are using the critical
    edition by Priyabala Shah -- in most cases bear a striking resemblance to
    those found in the \SS. Given the striking alignment between the list and
    definitions of \emph{tantrayukti}s, one could suggest that the
    \emph{Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa}'s chapter on \emph{tantrayukti}s likely
    draws directly or indirectly from the \SS\ or from a common
    source. The designations and the order of the \emph{tantrayukti}s in the
    \emph{Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa} are almost identical. The only differences
    in the order are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item \emph{Viparyaya} is placed after \emph{vidhāna} whereas in the \SS\  it 
	follows \emph{arthāpatti}.
	
	\item \emph{Anumata} is placed after \emph{vyākhyāna} whereas in the \SS\  
	follows \emph{niṛṇaya}.

	\item \emph{Anāgatāvekṣaṇa} (\emph{anāgatāpekṣaṇa} in the Nepalese 
	version) occurs after \emph{atikrāntāvekṣaṇa} (\emph{atikrāntāpekṣaṇa} in the 
	Nepalese version) whereas the order is reverse in the \SS.
	
\end{enumerate}

For a side-by-side comparison of the \emph{tantrayukti}s in the \SS\  and the 
\emph{Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa}, please refer to Table \ref{table-SAV}.


A list of the 32 \emph{tantrayukti}s accompanied by definitions also appear in the final chapter (\emph{Pariccheda} 28) of the final book (book 3: \emph{Suttamālā}) of the renowned Pali grammar \emph{Saddanīti} composed by Aggavaṃsa in Arimaddanapura (modern Bagan, Burma) in the twelfth-century.\footnote{\cite[920--921]{smit-1930}.} Just as the \emph{Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa}, this list also does not provide examples of the \emph{tantrayukti}s. Although written in Pali, the order and the definition of the \emph{tantrayukti}s (\emph{tantiyutti} in Pali) closely resemble those of the \SS. There are, however, a few differences:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The \emph{tantrayukti} \emph{pradeśa} is referred to as \emph{paṭidesa} (Sanskrit \emph{pratideśa}) and is positioned after \emph{atidesa} (Sanskrit \emph{atideśa}) whereas in the \SS it follows \emph{apadeśa}. 

\item \emph{Atikrāntāpekṣaṇa} is designated as \emph{atītāpekkhana} (Sanskrit \emph{atītāpekṣaṇa}).

\item \emph{Svasaṃjñā} is designated as \emph{anaññā sakasaṃjñā} (Sanskrit \emph{ananyā svasaṃjñā}) and is defined with subtle variations.

\item \emph{Ūhya} is designated as \emph{upānīya}. 

\end{enumerate}

For a side-by-side comparison of the \emph{tantrayukti}s in the \emph{Suśruta Saṃhitā} and the \emph{Saddanīti}, please refer to Table \ref{table-SAV}.

While references to \emph{tantrayukti}s can be found across various disciplines, Āyurveda places a particular emphasis on their discussion, especially evident in key texts of Āyurveda, such as the \emph{Caraka-} and the \emph{Suśruta- saṃhitā}s, as well as the \emph{Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha}. The \emph{Carakasaṃhitā} and \emph{Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha} present an identical list of \emph{tantrayukti}s. However, unlike the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} they lack explicit definitions and examples. This list of the \emph{tantrayukti}s appear in the final chapter of the last book in both \emph{Carakasaṃhitā} (41b--45a, chapter 12, \emph{Siddhisthāna}) and \emph{Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha} (150--153, chapter 50, \emph{Uttarasthāna}). The same has been quoted by Aruṇadatta in his commentary on the \emph{Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya} while elucidating the concept of \emph{tantraguṇa} (qualities of the system). Notably, this list consists of 36 \emph{tantrayukti}s instead of 32 found in the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} and other texts. The additional four are: \emph{prayojana} (objective), \emph{pratyutsāra} (rebuttal), \emph{uddhāra}, and \emph{sambhava} (origin). 

The commentators who extensively delved into the discussion of the \emph{tantrayukti}s are Bhaṭṭāraka Hariścandra, also known as Bhaṭṭāra Haricandra, who composed the \emph{Carakanyāsa} on the \emph{Carakasaṃhitā} around the mid-sixth century, and Aruṇadatta, who authored his commentary \emph{Sarvāṅgasundarī} on the \emph{Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya} of Vāgbhaṭa. Hariścandra meticulously defined and analyzed 40 \emph{tantrayukti}s at the beginning of his work. The four additional \emph{tantrayukti}s are:  \emph{paripraśna} (question), \emph{vyākaraṇa} (grammatical clarification), \emph{vyutkrāntābhidhāna} (overpassing statement) and \emph{hetu} (means of knowledge).\footnote{This text has only been published once 
	(only until the third chapter of \emph{Sūtrasthāna}) by Masta Ram Shastri from Lahore in 1932/33.\fvolcite{IB}[290]{meul-hist} Unfortunately, it is currently inaccessible to us. Although some fragmented manuscripts of the Carakanyāsa exist, for this section (Chapter 1, \emph{Sūtrasthāna}), we were able to consult only \MScite{MS Jamnagar GAU 114}. This is a recent apograph with several lacunae and corruptions. The list of the tantrayuktis provided in the \emph{Carakanyāsa} is as follows (with some emendations made in the reading): \dev{tantrasya yuktayo'dhikaraṇādyāścatvāriṃśat/... yuktayastāvadadhikaraṇaṃ yogo hetvartha uddeśa upadeśo'padeśo'tideśaḥ pradeśo nirṇayo'rthāpattirvākyaśeṣaḥ prayojanaṃ prasaṅga ekānto'nekānto viparyayo'pavargaḥ pūrvapakṣo vidhānamanumataṃ vyākhyānaṃ paripraśno vyākaraṇamatītāpekṣaṇamanāgatāpekṣaṇaṃ saṃśayaḥ svasaṃjñohyaḥ samuccayo nidarśanaṃ nirvacanaṃ niyogo vikalpaḥ pratyutsāra uddhāraḥ sambhavo vyutkrāntābhidhānaṃ heturiti/}}

Aruṇadatta, while discussing the concept of \emph{tantraguṇa} at the end of the \emph{Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya}, provided an elaborate description of \emph{tantrayukti}s, considering them as part of a system of ninety-five \emph{tantraguṇa}s. Śrīdāsapaṇḍita (14th century), a commentator on the \emph{Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya}, echoed Aruṇadatta's exploration of tantrayuktis in the beginning of his commentary, \emph{Hṛdayabodhikā}.\fvolcite{IA}[680]{meul-hist} Thus, both Hariścandra and Śrīdāsapaṇḍita engage with this topic right at the beginning, underscoring the significance they attribute to the subject. Other noteworthy commentators who discussed the topic of \emph{tantrayukti} are Cakrapāṇi (11th century) and Indu (sometime between 8th and 12th century). Cakrapāṇi and Indu defined and illustrated the \emph{tantrayukti}s mentioned in the \emph{Carakasaṃhitā} and the \emph{Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha}, respectively. They affirm the inclusion of the four additional \emph{tantrayukti}s in Hariścandra's list. Cakrapāṇi, aligning them with existing concepts, incorporates \emph{paripraśna}, \emph{vyākaraṇa}, and \emph{vyutkrāntābhidhāna} under the \emph{tantrayukti}s \emph{uddeśa}, \emph{vyākhyāna}, and \emph{nirdeśa}, respectively. According to him, \emph{hetu} serves as an overarching term encompassing all \emph{pramāṇa}s (means of knowledge) such as \emph{pratyakṣa} (perception) and others. Indu, however, outlines three possible reasons for not incorporating these \emph{tantrayukti}s into the list: (1) they lack direct mention in the main text, (2) they could be considered as falling within the scopes of already enumerated \emph{tantrayukti}s, or (3) they are not recognized as \emph{tantrayukti}s. \emph{Jalpakalpataru}, a nineteenth-century commentary on the \emph{Carakasaṃhitā} by Gaṅgādhara Kavirāja from Bengal also discusses the \emph{tantrayukti}s.  

two texts authored by Āyurvedic scholars exclusively delve into the topic of \emph{tantrayukti}. The first is the \emph{Tantrayuktivicāra} by a physician named Nīlamegha (also known as Vaidyanātha), while the second is called the \emph{Tantrayukti}, which is a sort of recast of the former by an anonymous author. The anonymous author describes himself as being from the same lineage as Nīlamegha and asserts that Nīlamegha belongs to the same lineage of Bhiṣagārya (also known as Nārāyaṇa Bhiṣaj). Both Nīlamegha and the author of Tantrayukti are likely from Kerala or coastal Karnataka.\footnote{Kolatteri Saṅkaramenon, 
	the first editor of the \emph{Tantrayuktivicāra}, believes that Nīlamegha hails from Kerala. This conclusion is drawn from Nīlamegha's reference to his guru as Sundara, whom Saṅkaramenon identifies as the same individual credited with composing the \emph{Lakṣaṇāmṛta}, a treatise on toxicology. This assertion is plausible because the only known manuscript of \emph{Tantrayuktivicāra} belongs to a member of one of the Aṣṭavaidya families of Kerala, aligning with the Vāgbhaṭa school, to which Nīlamegha also belongs.(\fvolcite{IIA}[143]{meul-hist}) On the other hand, the anonymous author of the \emph{Tantrayukti} associates Nīlamegha with the lineage of Bhiṣagārya, who hails from Uṇṭuru, a village located 3 kilometers from Gokarṇa which is in coastal Karnataka.\parencite[30]{nara-1949}.}
According to Koḷatteri Śaṅkaramenon and Meulenbeld, Nīlamegha flourished in the first half of ninth century.\footnote{Nīlamegha mentions Vāhaṭa (Vāgbhaṭa), Indu, and Jejjaṭa in his work.
	 This places him definitively after the seventh century. The Buddhist influence in the Tantrayukti indicates a date not much later than 800 AD. (\cite[\dev{avatārikā 5–6}]{muth-1976}, \fvolcite{IIA}[143]{meul-hist}.)} 
The \emph{Tantrayukti} was very likely composed after the sixteenth century.\footnote{From 
	the explicit mention of Nīlamegha and Bhiṣagārya in the work \emph{Tantrayukti}, we can say that the author flourished after them. Determining the date of Bhiṣagārya is problematic. However, since the Kairalī commentary on the \AHS frequently quotes from Bhiṣagārya's \emph{Abhidhānamañjarī}, it indicates that Bhiṣagārya predates the composition of this commentary. Meulenbeld suggests the end of the seventeenth century as the terminus post quem for the Kairalī (\fvolcite{IA}[675]{meul-hist}). Moreover, he views \emph{Abhidhānamañjarī} as a work composed after the sixteenth century, citing details within it that affirm its posteriority to the \emph{Rājanighaṇṭu} and \emph{Bhāvaprakāśa} (\fvolcite{IIA}[442]{meul-hist}).} 

\section{Terminology}


The definitions of \emph{tantrayukti}s exhibit numerous variations across different texts. Here we will discuss each of the \emph{tantrayukti}s that occur in the \emph{Suśruta Saṃhitā} in comparison with their definitions in other texts. As indicated in Table \ref{table-SAV}, the definitions of \emph{tantrayukti}s in the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} are frequently either identical or nearly identical to those found in the \emph{Arthaśāstra} and \emph{Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa}. Therefore, unless the definitions in these two texts notably deviate from those in the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā}, we will not make explicit references to them in the subsequent elucidation of the terms.


\subsection{1. \emph{adhikaraṇa}}

\emph{Adhikaraṇa} appears as the first \emph{tantrayukti} in all traditional enumerations. It is among those \emph{tantrayukti}s for which there is little disagreement concerning its definition. The \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} defines \emph{adhikaraṇa} as an object, with reference to which statements are made. While defining \emph{adhikaraṇa}, the text employs the same verb, \emph{adhi- kṛ-} (to refer), whence the noun \emph{adhikaraṇa} has been derived. This definition suggests that the word \emph{adhikaraṇa} formed by the \emph{-ana} suffix has a patient-like semantic meaning as opposed to the more common referents of the \emph{-ana} suffix, such as action nouns, locations, or instruments.\footnote{Cf. Aṣṭādhyāyī 3.3.115--117.} The text supplies examples of \emph{rasa} (taste) and \emph{doṣa} (humour), for which two chapters of the \emph{Uttaratantra}, namely chapter 62 (\emph{Kāyacikitsā} 27) and  chapter 65 (\emph{Kāyacikitsā} 30) are dedicated.\footnote{They are chapters 63 and 66 in the \colorbox{yellow}{vulgate.}.} Clearly, \emph{adhikaraṇa} is the topic or theme. 

Cakrapāṇi defines \emph{adhikaraṇa} in almost the same fashion.\footnote{\dev{yamarthamadhikṛtya pravartate kartā/ yathā “vighnabhūtā yadā rogā”
	ityādi/ atra rogādikamadhikṛtyāyurvedo maharṣibhiḥ kṛta iti ‘rogāḥ}’ \dev{ityadhikaraṇam/} \parencite[736]{cara-trikamji3}.}
Aruṇadatta's definition is similar but he specifies that \emph{adhikaraṇa} can be of a entire discipline \emph{(śāstra)}, or a book \emph{(sthāna)} of it, or a chapter \emph{(adhyāya)}, or a section \emph{(prakaraṇa)}, or even of a sentence \emph{(vākya)}.\footnote{\dev{tatra 
	adhikaraṇaṃ nāma, yadadhikṛtya pravartate śāstraṃ sthānamadhyāyaṃ prakaraṇaṃ vākyaṃ vā/...} \parencite[947]{kunt-1939}.} 
However, in the commentaries of Hariścandra and Indu, we explore two more aspects of the concept of \emph{adhikaraṇa}. According to Hariścandra, \emph{adhikaraṇa} is the reason or ground referring to which the authors direct their discourse. For example, diseases create misery and the authors of Āyurveda began their discussion addressing them.\footnote{\dev{tatrādhikaraṇaṃ nāma yannimittamadhikṛtya pravartate kartā/… uta vā
	vighnabhūtā yadā rogāḥ prādurbhūtāḥ tadidaṃ nimittamadhikṛtya jagadanukampayā maharṣibhirayamāyurveda āgamaḥ/ evamadhikaraṇavyākhyā varṇayitavyā/} MS Jamnagar GAU 114, p.4--5.}.
Thus disease is the \emph{adhikaraṇa} or theme of their discussion. Indu identifies \emph{adhikaraṇa} as a binding force that links ideas. According to him, \emph{adhikaraṇa} as an introductory reference and paraphrases it as something that exposes a general statement to a specific context.\footnote{\dev{adhikaraṇaṃ prastāvaḥ sāmānyenoktamapyarthajātam yadbalādviśeṣe'vasthāpyate tadadhikaraṇam/} \parencite[959]{atha-1980}.} 

In the \emph{Tolkāppiyam}, however, the equivalent expression for this \emph{tantrayukti} remains unclear, as commentators, namely Iḷampūraṇar and Pērāciriyar, list the item differently. In Sastri's translation of the Tolkāppiyam, adhikaraṇa was identified with \emph{atikāra muṟai}, the second element in Iḷampūraṇar's list. Sastri translates this expression as “deciding the extent where one serves as \emph{adhikāra sūtra} or a word or words in a sūtra taken along with the \emph{sūtra}-s that follow.”\footnote{\cite[233]{sast-1936}.} However, Dikshitar, in his brief article on the \emph{tantrayukti}s, equates \emph{adhikaraṇa} with \emph{nutaliyatu aṟital}, the first element in Pērāciriyar's list, and translates it as “that division of a book which centers around a chief topic and deals wholly with that topic.”\footnote{\cite[85]{diks-1930}} Clearly, Dikshitar's interpretation stands close to our definition of \emph{adhikaraṇa}. Sastri's interpretation, on the other hand, corresponds to the concept of \emph{adhikāra} “heading” and \emph{anuvṛtti} “recurrence” in the \emph{sūtra} literature, especially in Pāṇini's \emph{Aṣṭādhyāyī}.\footnote{See \cite[111]{chev-2009}.} 

Oberhammer and Meulenbeld translate \emph{adhikaraṇa} as “topic,” and we have adopted the same translation.\footnote{\cite[601]{ober-1968}, \fvolcite{IB}[431]{meul-hist}.} Sharma translates the term as the “scope of the topic.”\footnote{\fvolcite{3}[631]{shar-1999}.}

\item [4] It is said about this, “what is the purpose of these methods?”
The answer is, “construing sentences and construing
meanings”.\footnote{\Dalhana{6.65.4}{815} explained “construing a
    sentence” as “connecting up a sentence that is not connected,” and
    “construing a meaning” as “clarifying  or making appropriate a meaning
    that is implied or inppropriate.”}

\item [5-6] There are \diff{two} verses about this:
  
\begin{sloka}
The logical methods of the system prohibit
statements employed by people who do not speak the truth.
%untrue and unsuitable statements. 
They also bring about the validity of one’s own
statements.  And they also clarify meanings that are stated back to
front, that are implicit, unclear and any that are partially stated.
\end{sloka}

\item [8] Among them, “\se{adhikaraṇa}{topic}” refers to the object, with 
reference to which statements are made, such as \se{rasa}{flavour} or 
\se{doṣa}{humour}.\footnote{The idea here is that “\emph{rasa}” may be the 
topic of a chapter, and statements in that chapter are all understood to be about 
that topic}

\item [9] “\se{yoga}{Construing}” is that by which a sentence
is construed, as when words that are in a reversed order, whether placed close
or apart, have their meanings unified.

\end{quote}
In this verse, one ought to say, first, “one should drink
cooked\ldots.” However, the word “cooked” is used in the second
line.\footnote{The Nepalese version reads \dev{dvitīye pāde} which would
    properly mean the second quarter of the first line; the vulgate reads
    “third quarter” which seems more correct.} Unifying the meanings of words in
    this way, even though they are far apart, is construing. 
 

\item [10] 

The meaning that is conveyed in an \se{sūtra}{aphorism} or a word is 
called \se{padārtha}{word-meaning}. In other words, word-meaning is the 
meaning of one or more words. Word-meanings are unlimited. 

Where two or three meanings such as `fat,’ `sweat’ or `anointment’ appear
to be possible, the valid meaning is the one that construes with prior
and subsequent elements.\footnote{There is a dangling relative clause,
    \dev{yo 'rthaḥ}, in the Nepalese version that is avoided in the vulgate
    recension by the addition of \dev{sa grahītavyaḥ}.} For example, when it
    is said that, “We are going to explain the chapter on the
    \emph{veda}-origin” the mind may be confused about which “\emph{veda}”
    will be spoken about. \emph{Sāmaveda} and so on are the Vedas. Taking
    note of the prior and subsequent elements, the two roots \emph{vind}
    ”find” and \emph{vid} “know” have a single meaning. Subsequently, the
    understanding takes place that there is a wish to talk about the origin
    of āyurveda.  So that is the meaning of the word.\footnote{The Nepalese
        text here is hard to follow, and the vulgate has a significantly
        different reading. But the problem situation seems to be as follows.  The
        \SS\ opens with a statement saying that it will describe the “origin of
        the \emph{veda}” (\emph{vedotpatti}).  The problem is, what does this
        word “\emph{veda}” refer to?  Is it the Veda, as in Sāmaveda?  Or
        something derived from the roots \root vind or \root vid?  Context
        (“prior and subsequent elements”) can help us to know that “\emph{veda}”
        means only “\emph{āyurveda}” and that the \SS\ is talking about the
        origin of ayurveda, specifically.  This same issue is also addressed by 
        Ḍalhaṇa at \Su{1.1.1}{1}.}

\item [11] \se{hetvartha}{The sense of the cause} is a statement that is
a \se{sādhana}{premiss}.  For example, just as a lump of earth is
moistened by water, so a wound is moistened by substances like milk with
\gls{māṣa}.\footnote{The way this principle is expressed here seems to be
    describing the application of a general principle (water makes things
    wet) to a specific context. We can know the moistening of a wound because
    we know the more general case of moistening earth. However,
    etymologically, \dev{hetvartha} does not mean “analogy,” but rather,
    something like “purpose of the reason.”  The phrase “the sense of cause”
    that we have used leans on the use of the term in commentaries on the
    \emph{Aṣṭādhyāyī} (\emph{Kaumudī} on 2.3.23). The vulgate of the \SS\
    rewrites the principle, making it clearer that the principle means
    “clarification by analogy.”  Cf.\ also Cakrapāṇi's discussion at
    \Ca{Si.12.41}{736}, where he explained the principle as using an
    explanation from one situation to clarify another situation. Cf.\
    \emph{Arthaśāstra} 5.1.13 \citep[436]{oliv-2013}, which is also unclear.
    }\q{See also Ḍalhaṇa at \Su{1.1.1}{1}}
\item [12] A \se{samuddeśa}{mention} is a brief statement such as 
“\se{śalya}{spike}”.\footnote{Generally, \dev{śalya} refers to any painful 
foreign body embedded in the flesh that requires surgical removal.}

\item [13] A \se{nirdeśa}{description} is a detailed statement. For example, “in 
the body or exogenous”.\footnote{This is a reference to \Su{1.26.4}{121}
    where \dev{śalya} is described in more detail as being of two kinds.} 

\item [14] “\se{upadeśa}{Prescription}” refers to statements like ``it should be 
this way.'' For example, one should not stay awake at night; 
one should not sleep during the day.  

\item [15] “\se{apadeśa}{Statement of reason}” refers to statements like “this 
happens because of this.” For example, in the sentence “Sweet substances 
increase phlegm,” the reason is stated.\footnote{A techical term also in 
Nyāyaśāstra \citep[54]{jhal-1978}.}  

\item [16] Substantiation of the subject matter through past evidence is
“\se{pradeśa}{indication}.” For example, he pulled out Devadatta's
\se{śalya}{splinter}, therefore he will pull out Yajñadatta's.

\item [17] Substantiation of the subject matter through a future event is
“\se{atideśa}{prediction}.” For example, if his wind moves upwards, that
will cause him to have colic.”\footnote{A techical term also in
    Nyāyaśāstra \citep[6--7]{jhal-1978}.}

\item [18] A deviation after generalization is \se{apavarga}{exception}. For example, those afflicted by poison should not go through sudorific treatment other than the cases of poisoning by urinary worms.

\item [19] \se{vākyaśeṣa}{Ellipsis} refers to an unstated word that completes a sentence. For example, despite not mentioning the word 'person', when mentioning someone as 'the one having a head, hands, feet, flanks, and abdomen,' it's apparent that the reference is to a person. 

\item [20] \se{Implication}{arthāpatti} refers to an unstated idea that becomes evident through context. For example, when one said, “We will eat rice” it becomes evident from the context that he did not wish to drink gruel. 

\item [21] When there is the reversal of it it is \se{viparyaya}{contraposition}. For example, when it is said, "Weak, dyspneic, and fearful people are difficult to treat," the converse holds true: "Those who are strong and so on are easily treatable." 

\item [22] \se{prasaṅga}{Recontextualization} refers to a concept common to another section. For example, a concept belonging to another section is brought up by mentioning it repeatedly throughout. 

\item [23] \se{ekānta}{Invariable statement} is one that is stated with certainty. For example, \gls{trivṛt} causes purgation; \gls{madana} induces vomiting.

\item [24] \se{anekānta}{Variable statement} is one that is true in one way in 
some cases and in another way elsewhere. For example, some teachers identify 
the main element as substance, others as fluid, some as semen, and some as 
digestion.\q{See chapter 40 of Sūtrasthāna.}

\item [25]  A \se{pūrvapakṣa}{first point of view} is something stated
with certainty.  For example, how are the four types of diabetes caused
by wind incurable?\footnote{The adverb \dev{niḥsaṃśayam} is problematic:
    the example expresses a query or doubt, the opposite of certainty, which
    is answered in the next passage.  It would seem to make more sense to
    read something like \dev{yas tu sasaṃśayam abhidhīyate sa pūrvapakṣaḥ},
    but our manuscripts are unanimous in their reading.}

\item [26] Its answer is determination. For example, afflicting the body and 
trickling downwards, it creates urine mixed with fat, fatty tissues, and 
marrow.\q{vasā / medas / majjan} Thus, those caused by wind are incurable. 

\item [28] \se{anumata}{Consent} refers to others' opinion that is not rejected. For example, when the assertor says that there are six flavours and that somehow gets accepted with affirmation, it is termed consent.

\item [29] \se{vidhāna}{Itemization} refers to sequentially ordered statements within a chapter. For example, the eleven lethal points of thigh are mentioned sequentially in a chapter.

\item [30] A statement like “Thus will be stated” is \se{anāgatāpekṣaṇa}{future 
reference} such as when he says in the \emph{Sūtrasthāna}, “I will mention it in 
the \emph{Cikitsāsthāna}.” 

\item [31] A statement like “Thus has been stated” is 
\se{atikrāntāpekṣaṇa}{past reference} such as when one says in the 
\emph{Cikitsāsthāna}, “As mentioned in the \emph{Sūtrasthāna}\ldots.” 

\item [32] An indication pointing to causes on both sides is
\se{saṃśaya}{doubt}. For example, a blow to
\sse{talahṛdaya}{sole-heart}\footnote{\dev{talahṛdaya} is one of the
    muscle-group of lethal points mentioned in \Su{3.6.7}{370}.}  is fatal,
    whereas cutting hands and feet is not fatal.

\item [33] An elaborate description is \se{vyākhyāna}{explication}. For example, 
the twenty-fifth entity, \sse{puruṣa}{person}, is being explicated here. Thus, no 
other Āyurvedic texts discuss  entities beginning with matters. \q{Does 
bhūtādi a compound or it means ahaṅkāra or ego?}

\item [34] \se{svasaṃjñā}{Field-specific term} is uncommon in other field of 
studies. The term used in one's own systems is called field-specific term, such as 
in this system, \sse{mithuna}{pair} denotes honey and ghee, and 
\sse{mithuna}{triad} denotes ghee, sesame oil and fat. 

\item [35] A customary potrayal is \se{nirvacana}{interpretation}. For example, one goes along the shade fearing heat. 

\item [36] Providing examples is \se{nidarśana}{illustration}. For example, just as fire spreads rapidly in a dry forest when accompanied by wind, a wound intensifies affected by wind, bile, and phlegm.  

\item [37] A statement like “This is the only way...” ...\se{niyoga}{compulsion}. For example, one should consume only a healthy diet.     

\item [39] A statement like “This and this\ldots” is
\se{vikalpa}{option}. For example, in the section on meat, the major ones
are blackbuck, deer, quail and partridge.\footnote{The example here
    matches \dev{samuccaya} (next text), not \dev{vikalpa}.  There seems to
    have been a metathesis of terms. \citet[1005, footnote
    6]{susr-trikamji1945} notes that this text and the next have been swapped
    in the Calcutta edition that includes Hārāṇacandra's commentary
    \volcite{2}{bhat-1910}, in the same way as in the Nepalese version.}

\item [38] A summarized statement is
\se{samuccaya}{aggregation}.\footnote{As stated in the previous footnote, the 
example here is of \dev{vikalpa}, not \dev{samuccaya}.
%    The term \dev{samāsavacana}, which
%   means more or less the same as \dev{saṃkṣepavacana}, has already been
%    used in tantrayukti \dev{samuddeśa}
    } For example, let there be rice
    with meat broth, rice with milk, or burley with ghee.
    
    \begin{quote}
        A meaningful reading of these two rules would be
    
    39 idaṃ vedaṃ veti vikalpaḥ / yathā rasodanaḥ kṣīrodanaḥ saghṛtā vā 
    yavāgūr bhavatv iti //
    
    38 saṃkṣepavacanaṃ samuccayaḥ / yathā māṃsavarge eṇahariṇalāvatittirāḥ 
    pradhānā iti
    \end{quote}
    

\item [40] What is not explicitly stated but can be understood through discernment is \se{ūhya}{deducible}. For example, in the section on rules of foods and drinks, four types of foods and drinks are mentioned— \se{bhakṣya}{masticable}, \se{bhojya}{edible}, \se{lehya}{suckable}, and \se{peya}{drinkable}. Thus, while four types are needed to be stated, two types are actually mentioned. Here it is deducible that in the section on foods and drinks, by specifically mentioning two types, the four types are also mentioned. Furthermore, a masticable item is not excluded from the category of food because it shares the same characteristic of solidity. A suckable item is not excluded from being classified as a drink because it shares the same characteristic of liquidity. Four types of aliments are rare. They are usually just twofold. Therefore, lord Dhanvantari says “Twofold is popular”.
