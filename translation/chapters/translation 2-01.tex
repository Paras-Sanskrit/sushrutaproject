\begin{translation}

\item [1] And now we shall explain the chapter about diagnosis of
diseases caused by wind.\footnote{Present chapter discribes the diseases caused by vitiated wind and its mixing with other humours. In the medical term it is known as rheumatism.}

\item[2]

\item[3] Suśruta asks after holding the feet of Dhanvantari who is the foremost of the upholders of righteousness and who
emerged with nectar.

\item[4] O King!\footnote{ H and N both mss read \dev{bhūpate }instead of
\dev{kaupanaiḥ} in the vulgate.} Divodāsa\footnote{https://doi.org/10.20935/AL2992} the best of the orators! Let us know about
the naturalized and disordered form of wind, its places in the body and
types of the diseases caused by its contamination.

\item[5--9ab] On hearing his words, the venerable sage replied that being
independent, constant and omnipresent this wind is revealed as self-born
and supreme being. It is worshiped by all words and situated in the form of life-force in all beings. It is the cause of origin, continued
existence and destruction of beings. It is unmanifest though manifests
in/through action, cold, dry, light in weight, variable, moving
horizontally with two attributes i.e., sound and
tangibility\footnote{According to Ḍalhaṇa, it has power to divide
humours, fluids, feces etc. moving inside the body and it is the cause to
the disease in the limbs. It carries humours, chyle, semen/7 fluids? and
feces further in the body. The wind which is moving outside is holding
the earth and body. (\dev{sā cāsya śaktiḥ
śarīradoṣamūtrapurīṣādivibhāgo'vayavasaṃsthānakā(ka)raṇaṃ 
doṣadhātumalasaṃvahanādiśca,
śarīrādbahistu saṃcarato dharaṇīdhāraṇādiḥ  }  Su 1938:257)}. Having all
chief qualities which are sattva, rajas and tamas but predominated by
rajas. It has inconceivable power. It is inducer of humours\footnote{
Ḍalhaṇa suggests \dev{netā=preraka} (Su 1938:257)} and distinguished in
the group of diseases\footnote{ Ḍalhaṇa suggests \dev{rāṭ=rājate} not 
\dev{rājā}}. \emph{\textbf{It move}\textbf{s quickly, moves again and
again, }}stays in stomach and intestine.

\item[9cd] Now, listen to the description of wind which moves inside the
body.

\item[10] Unvitiated wind makes possible objects of senses connect with
intellect. It maintains a state of equilibrium between the humours,
semen/7 fluids? and Gastric fluid and actions done by body, speech and
intellect bring to one's right place.\footnote{ According to Ḍalhaṇa,
\dev{sampattiḥ=sampannatā} at 1.6.3 (Su1938:23). Ḍalhaṇa commented that
Gayadāsa reads \dev{`indriyārthopasaṃprāptiṃ'} but not written here
because of being detailed. (\dev{gayadāsācāryastu imaṃ ślokaṃ
`indriyārthopasaṃprāpti' ityādi kṛtvā paṭhati, sa 
ca vistarabhayānna likhitaḥ)} But H and N MSS suggest  
`\dev{indriyārthopasampattiḥ}'}

\item[11] Just as the five types of bile have been described based 
on their
name, place and their actions, similarly, one type of air is of five
types based on name, place, action and diseases.

\item[12] Five types of wind:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
\begin{quote}
Vital wind (\emph{prāṇa})
\end{quote}
\item
\begin{quote}
\emph{udāna }
\end{quote}
\item
\begin{quote}
\emph{samāna}
\end{quote}
\item
\begin{quote}
\emph{vyāna}
\end{quote}
\item
\begin{quote}
\emph{apāna}
\end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
above five types of wind remain in their equilibrium and hold the
body\footnote{ Ḍalhaṇa suggests \dev{sthāna=sāmya, yāpayanti=dhārayanti}
(The manuscripts all read \dev{prāṇodānaḥ samānaśca vyānopānastathaiva ca .
}   against the vulgate's \dev{prāṇodānau samānaśca vyānaścāpāna eva
ca . } I think \dev{prāṇodānau, vyānāpānau} or \dev{vyānaścāpāna eva ca
} should be read)}.
\end{quote}

\item[13--14ab] The wind that flows through the mouth is called the
vitality (prāṇa), which holds the body. It propels down food inside the
stomach and engages with the gastric fluid\footnote{ Ḍalhaṇa suggests
head, chest, throat and nose as locations of prāṇa. (Sus1938:259)
Gayadāsa suggests \dev{agni} for \dev{prāṇa}.}. Unvitiated Vital wind
mostly causes hiccups, asthma etc. diseases.

\item[14cd--15] The wind which flows upwards in the body, the best among
all five winds is called udāna. Singing, speech etc. individual things
done by the same wind. Unvitiated udāna wind mostly causes diseases above
the collar bone e.g., nose, eyes, head and ears\footnote{ Ḍalhaṇa
suggests it also causes diseases like cough etc. (\dev{cakārādanyādapi
prāṇodānau, vyānāpānau kāsādīn karoti .})}.

\item [16--17ab] The samāna wind flows in stomach and duodenum. It helps
gastric fluids in the digestion of food and separates the substances
produced from it e.g., chyle, impurities, urine and feces. Unvitiated
samāna wind causes diseases like a chronic enlargement of spleen (gulma),
weak digestion, and diarrhea.

\item[17cd--18] The vyāna wind moves inside the whole body and circulates
chyle and expels sweat and blood outside the body. It helps in the
movements of limbs in every way. Contaminated vyāna wind causes all
diseases occurring in the body.

\item[19--20ab] Staying in the abdomen, the apāna wind propels wind of
body, feces, urine, semen, womb and menstruation to come out of the body
at their proper time. Contaminated apāna wind causes terrible diseases
that occur in the bladder and anus.

\item[20cd--21ab] Contaminated vyāna and apāna wind causes defect of 
semen 
and gonorrhea, while simultaneous contamination of all the five winds surely 
leads to death.  

% The diseases caused by contaminated wind staying in different places of the 
%body are being described.

\item[21cd--22ab] I shall therefore describe all the diseases caused by the 
contamination of winds staying in the various places of the body.

\item[22cd--24ab] Contaminated wind in the stomach causes disease like
vomiting, loss of consciousness, fainting, thirst, heart-seizure, pain in
lateral sides of stomach. It also causes rumbling of the bowels, acute
pain, inflated belly, pain while discharging urine and feces, suppression
of urine and pain in the loins.

\item[24cd]Contaminated wind residing in the ear causes loss of function of the 
senses.

\item[25--29] Residing in the skin,\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa and Gayadāsa both 
suggest \dev{tvak=rasa}. Gayadāsa explained that chyle stays in the skin and 
therefore, in the verse \dev{tvakstha} should be read as \dev{rasastha} as we 
read 
secondary meaning in the sentences like \dev{gaṅgāyāṃ ghoṣaḥ}.} 
contaminated 
wind causes discoloration of skin, throbbing of parts of the body, dryness, 
numbness, itching, pricking pain, swelling. It being inherent in the flesh of body 
causes swelling with pain and being inherent with the fat of the body causes 
swelling with slight pain but do not become wound.\footnote{The MS H does 
not 
read \dev{vraṇāṃśca raktago granthīn saśūlān māṃsasaṃśritaḥ .} against the 
vulgate. 
\citep[261]{vulgate}.}

Residing in the artery it causes acute pain, contraction and filling up of the 
artery.\footnote{According to Ḍalhaṇa \dev{sirākuñcanaṃ} is also known as 
\dev{kuṭilā sirā} \citep[262]{vulgate}} It stuns, vibrates and 
destroys\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa and Gayadāsa both suggest the meaning of 
\dev{hanti} for being not capable of both stretching and contraction. 
\dev{sandhigataḥ saṃdhīn hanti prasāraṇākuñcanayorasāmarthyaṃ karoti} 
\citep[262]{vulgate} 
...} 
the muscle tissues by residing in the muscle. Residing in the joints it causes 
pain 
and swelling. Residing in the bone it causes fracture and dryness of bones 
which 
also cause to acute pain and, in the marrow, it dries up marrow which may 
never 
be cured. Residing in the semen it causes non-production and distorted 
production of semen.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa and Gayadāsa both suggest that a 
distorted production \dev{vikṛtāṃ pravṛttim} is too fast, too slow, knotty and 
discolored.} 


\item[30--31ab] Contaminated wind moves from the hand, foot, head, then it 
may be omnipresent or pervade the entire body of men and causes stiffness, 
convulsion, numbness and acute pain.

\item[31cd--32ab] Wind (5 types) mixed with other doṣas (bile etc.) in the 
places mentioned above produces mixed types of pains.

% Symptoms of diseases combined with other humours (bile etc.) of prāṇa 
%wind.
\item[34cd--35ab] Prāṇa wind surrounded by bile causes vomiting and burning 
sensation, by phlegm it causes weakness, exhaustion, laziness and bad taste. 

% Symptoms of diseases combined with other humours (bile etc.) of udāna 
%wind.
\item[35cd--36ab] Udāna wind surrounded by bile causes loss of 
consciousness, stupor, dizziness and fatigue, by phlegm it causes absence of 
perspiration, slowness of digestion, sensation of coldness.

% Symptoms of diseases combined with other humours (bile etc.) of samāna 
%wind.
\item[36cd--37ab] Samāna wind surrounded by bile causes perspiration, a 
burning sensation, heat and stupor, association with phlegm it causes erection 
in 
urine, feces and limbs.  

% Symptoms of diseases combined with other humours (bile etc.) of apāna 
%wind.
\item[37cd--38ab] Apāna wind associated with bile causes a burning sensation, 
heat and the voiding of blood with urine, with phlegm it causes a feeling of 
heaviness in the lower part of the body and coldness.

% Symptoms of diseases combined with other humours (bile etc.) of vyāna 
%wind.
\item[38cd--39ab] Vyāna wind surrounded by bile causes a burning sensation, 
tossing of the limbs and fatigue, by phlegm it causes stiffening limbs, 
uddaṇḍaka? and pain in the swelling.

\item[40--41] Persons who are of delicate nature, follow faulty diet and lifestyle, ? also afflicted with intoxicating drinks, 	sexual enjoyment, exercise causes vitiation of wind and blood.??

\item[42] Riding elephant, horse and camel, lifting great weights, consuming vegetables which are pungent, hot, sour, alkali and being frequently distressed situation causes contamination of wind. 

\item[43--44] Blood flowing in the body blocks the passage of contaminated wind which moves quickly in the body. Excessively irritated wind--being contaminated by wind and dominance of wind, it is called \dev{वातरक्त} Gout\footnote{In the medical term \dev{वातरक्त} is known as Gout. Cakrapāṇi called it \dev{आढ्यरोगः} Carakasaṃhitā sū.14.18 and ci.28.66}.

\item[45-46] Vātarakta causes -- pricking pain, dryness, loos of sensation in the feet. Contaminated Bile mixed with blood causes sharp burning sensation, excessive heat and soft swelling with red color in the feet. Contaminated Phlegm mixed with the blood causes itching in the feet. It makes feet white, cold, dry, thick and hard. All defects \footnote{Gayadāsa suggests \dev{सर्वे दुष्टाः शोणितं चापि} nominative plural instead of locative singular.} in the blood contaminated by humours (wind, bile, phlegm) manifest their symptoms in the feet.

\item[48] This disease spreads all over the body like rat poison by staying in feet or sometimes hands.

\item[49] Gout spreads in the knee and the skin bursts and starts bleeding makes it incurable. It is mitigatable if it is of a year’s old.

\item[50--51] When vitiated wind enters in the all arteries it causes quickly convulsions again and again and because of frequent convulsions \{आक्षेप} it is called \dev{आक्षेपक}.

%types of \dev{अपतानक} are being described.
\item[52--56] Because in this situation a person often sees darkness and fall, it calls \se{अपतानक}{spasmodic contraction} \footnote{Gayadāsa accepted the Nepalese reading \dev{ताम्यते} which vulgate does not read. Gayadāsa gives definition of \dev{अपतानक} as \dev{येनापताम्यते} means a situation in that a person sees the dark.} . If wind mixed with phlegm stays excessively in the arteries, it stiffs body like a staff and it is called \dev{दण्डापतानकः} epilepsy with convulsions. Vitiated wind entered in the arteries and bends the body like a bow, it is called \dev{धनुःस्तम्भ} Tetanus. 
When vitiated wind accumulated in the regions of finger, ancle, abdomen, heart, chest, and throat swiftly attack on the group of vain and ligaments, it gets a person’s eyes stuck, chin stuns, side breaks and vomiting phlegm he moves inwards like a bow and this situation is known as \se{अन्तरायाम}{emprosthotonos}. When vitiated wind attacks on outside ligaments, body of a person will stretch forward like a bow. In this situation, if the chest, hip or thigh break, wise men call it incurable.

\item[58] Aggravated phlegm and bile mixed with wind or only vitiated wind causes fourth convulsive disease due to trauma.

\item[59] Convulsions due to miscarriage, excessive bleeding, and injury are incurable \footenote{According to Ḍalhaṇa \se{आक्षेपक}{convulsion} is also known as \dev{अपतानक} (Su 1938:266). He further mentions that even if fortunately, it is cured, it cripples the limb.}.

\item[60--62] When excessively agitated and strong wind flows in the arteries which spread downward, upward, and sideways, it loses the joints and kills the other side of body. The best of physicians calls it \se{पक्षाघात}{paralysis}. \footnote{In the ca.6.28.55 \dev{पक्षाघात} is described as \se{एकाङ्गरोगः}{monoplegia}. In that case it damages one of the limbs.  In the medical terms \se{पक्षाघात}{paralysis} is known as hemiplegia.} Then half of his entire body becomes inefficient and unconscious. Afflicted by wind he suddenly falls or dies.

\item[62.1] Bile integrates with wind causes burning sensation, affliction, and infatuation. When it integrates with phlegm causes coldness, morbid swelling, and heaviness. \footnote{This verse is not available in vulgate. It deals with the symptoms when bile and phlegm mix with the wind. It is already discussed in su.2.1.38.}. 

\item[63] A \se{पक्षाघात}{paralysis} caused by wind \footnote{Here the term \dev{शुद्धवात} suggests the meaning of the wind that is devoid of bile and phlegm.} is curable with most difficulty. It becomes curable when caused by bile and phlegm mix with the wind. It becomes incurable when caused by the loss of bodily constituents.

\item[64--66] Verses from 64--66 are not found in the Nepalese manuscripts. These verses discuss the term \se{अपतन्त्रक}{spasmodic contradiction} which is the same as \dev{अपतानक}. Ḍalhaṇa commented on ni.1.64-66 (Su 1938:267) that because of having the similar condition in both situations, some scholars do not read the \dev{अपतन्त्रक}. In the verse ni.1.59 Ḍalhaṇa commented that the \dev{आक्षेपक} and \dev{अपतानक} is same (Su 1938:266) and again he suggested that the \dev{अपतानक} and \dev{अपतन्त्रक} both are similar condition. Therefore, \dev{आक्षेपक}, \dev{अपतानक} and \dev{अपतन्त्रक} should be the same. Gayadāsa further commented that the Caraka has not read \dev{आक्षेपक} as \dev{अपतानक} and therefore described the \dev{अपतन्त्रक} separately (Su 1938:267).

\item[67] This verse also not found in the Nepalese Manuscripts. The verse describes \se{मन्यास्तम्भ}{rigidity of neck}. According to Ḍalhaṇa, rigidity of neck is a prior symptom of spasmodic contradiction. 

% \se{अर्दित}{spasm of the jaw-bones}
\item[68--72] By speaking very loudly, eating hard foods, excessively laughing and yawning, lifting heavy loads and sleeping in an awkward position, vitiated wind lodges into face painfully and produces \se{अर्दित}{spasm of the jaw-bones} disease. In that case, half of the face and neck become curved, head trembles, speech hindrances, deformity occurs in the eys, eyebrows and cheeks.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa suggests \dev{नेत्रादीनाम् इत्यादि शब्दात् भूगण्डादि उपसङ्ग्रहः}} Experts in diseases call this disease \se{अर्दितं}{spasm of the jaw-bones} 

\item[73] Spasm of the jawbones cannot be cured when it stays in a person for three years, who is very weak, stays without blinking, trembles, and constantly speaks gibberish.

\item[74] Arteries of Heel and toes stricken by vitiated wind prevents stretching of thighs. This disease is known as \se{गृध्रसी}{sciatica}.

\item[75] Arteries which run to the tips of fingers from behind the roots of the upper arm affected by vitiated wind terminates all activities of arms and back. This disease is called \se{विश्वञ्चि}{paralysis of arms and back}. \footnote{Both the MSS N and H read \dev{विश्वञ्चि} instead of the vulgate reading \dev{विश्वाची}. There is no such word found in other Āyurveda texts.}

\item[76] Vitiated wind and blood in the joint of knee causes \se{क्रोष्टुकशीर्ष}{Synovitis of knee join}. In this extremely painful situation, the shape of swelling in knee joints seems like a head of Jackal. 

\item[77] Vitiated wind resides in the waist attacks on the arteries of thigh causes \se{खञ्ज}{limpness} and when it attacks on both the thighs a person becomes \se{पङ्गु}{lame}.

\item[78] A person who trembles at the beginning of walking or walks limping and whose foot joint has become loose is called \se{कलायखञ्ज}{lathyrism}.

\item[79] Vitiated wind residing in the ankle-joint causes pain when one steps on uneven ground. This disease occurs is called \dev{वातकण्टक}.

\item[80] Vitiated wind mixed with bile and blood cause burning sensation in feet. It should be declared as \se{पाददाह}{burning sensation in feet}.

\item[81] A person whose feet tingle and become insensible due to vitiation of phlegm and wind is called \dev{पादहर्ष}.

\item[82] Vitiated wind lying in the shoulder dries the shoulder joints and it is called \dev{अंसशोष}. It also bends the arteries of shoulder, and this disease is called \dev{अवबाहुक}. \footnote{Ḍalhaṇa and Gayadāsa both have defined two diseases i.e., \dev{अंसशोष} and \dev{अवबाहुक} respectively.}

\item[83] Vitiated wind singly or mixed with phlegm cover the channel of ears causes deafness.

\item[84] Vitiated wind saturated with phlegm covering the arteries which conduct the sound of speech makes a person \se{अक्रिय}{inactive}, \se{मूक}{dumb}. He \se{मिर्म्मिर}speaks indistinctly through the nose and \se{गद्गद}{stammers}.\footnote{Nepalese Manuscripts read \dev{मिर्म्मिर} instead of the Vulgate’s reading \dev{मिन्मिण}. Dictionary of MW suggests the meaning of \dev{मिर्म्मिर} = having fixed unwinking eyes which is not relevant to the disease of tongue.}
