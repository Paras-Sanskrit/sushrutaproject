    \item [1]
    Now we shall explain the \se{kalpa}{procedure} about the therapy for 
    someone bitten by a snake.\footnote{On \dev{kalpa}, see note 
    \ref{arunadatta:kalpa}.}
    
    \item[3] For any person bitten on a limb by any snake, one should
first of all make a strong binding, at four fingers measure above the
bite.\footnote{Application of a tourniquet is deprecated by
    modern establishment medicine, which relies on antivenom medications
    \citep[e.g.,][150--151 et passim in the literature]{pill-2013}.}
