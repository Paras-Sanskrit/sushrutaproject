\chapter{The Manuscripts}

Our edition is based on the textual evidence of three manuscripts.  All three were
produced in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal and preserved in libraries there.
\textcites[\S 2.1]{kleb-2021b} provided a comprehensive description of the
individual manuscripts, quotes and translates their colophons and thoroughly
examines various problems involved in their interpretation.\footnote{See also 
\cite{hari-2010,hari-2011,hari-2014}.} That is why we will
present only the key data essential for the study of our edition in the present
paper. In referring to the manuscripts, we use the sigla K, N and H, which
correspond to the initial letters in the names of the libraries and collection
where the respective bundles were discovered.

    \item[\MS{Kathmandu KL 699}, siglum K] This manuscript has been preserved at
the Kaiser Shamsher (KL) library in Kathmandu, accession number KL
699.\footnote{See also the description by \citet[\S 2.1]{kleb-2021b}.} See
Fig.\,\ref{fig:017r-img0065} It was microfilmed and catalogued by the NGMPP/
NGMCP as C 80-7.%

 (accessed on October 22, 2021).%
} The MS comprises 152 palm-leaf folios that originally belonged to several
different codicological units written by different scribes.%
\footnote{%
\textcites[46]{bhat-2020} and \textcites[11]{kleb-2021b} agree that four to five
scribes were involved in the manuscript's production. } The folios are 53.5
$\times$ 4.4 cm in size and have two string holes.  The text is written in the
so-called transitional Gupta script, with six to eight lines per
folio.\footnote{Codicological features of the manuscript, such as the layout,
peculiarities of the script, various ornamental and text-dividing symbols and many
more, were scrutinized in \textcites{bhat-2020}.} The MS is incomplete and
contains a large part of the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} as well as the
\emph{Sauśrutanighaṇṭu}.\footnote{\textcite[11]{kleb-2021b} provided a detailed
description of the content.} The date stated in the colophon at the end of the
compendium is verified for Sunday, April 13, 878 \CE. However, some controversy is
involved in interpreting the exact roles of two persons mentioned in the same
concluding remarks, someone called Śrī Harṣacandra and Vaidya Vasuvarman.
\textcites[16]{kleb-2021b} thinks that the former,
    \begin{quote}
        \ldots either sponsored the copying enterprise or wrote the manuscript himself,
        [and that he subsequently] donated it to Vaidya Vasuvarman on the condition that
        he (Vasuvarman) would study the text and explain it to others. The second
        condition was that the manuscript should remain in the family and not be given
        away either for sale or as a pawn. If the manuscript sat unused, it should be
        returned to Śrī Harṣacandra.\footnote{\textcite[13--17]{kleb-2021b} gave a
        translation and study of the colophon, as well as an exposition of different
        positions related to its interpretation.}

    5\,cm in size, with two string holes each, and it is bundled together in a composite 
    manuscript with at least one other medical work. The text is written in a variety of 
    Newari script, with ca.\ seven lines per folio. Although the text contained in the MS 
    does not cover the entire \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} and breaks off abruptly in the 
    second chapter of the \emph{śārīrasthāna}, the actual MS, as a codicological unit, 
    appears complete, that is, no leaf seems to be missing from the originally unitary 
    artefact. Based on paleographic considerations, the MS can be dated tentatively to 
    the twelfth or thirteenth century.

    Newari script that is more recent than that of N, with approximately six lines per 
    folio. The MS is exceptionally well preserved.  Most importantly for the present 
    project, the MS supports the complete \SS\ and the \emph{Sauśrutanighaṇṭu}. The 
    final colophon identifies the scribe of the MS as Vaidya Amarasiṃhaka, son of 
    Kamaladatta, and states the date on which he concluded the copying of the text. 
    Both reading the colophon, that is, deciphering the actual characters, and the 
    interpretation of the concerned passage involve diverging opinions, all of which 
    concur, however, in assigning the MS to the sixteenth century. 
    \textcite[21--26]{kleb-2021b} gave an analytical account of the views expressed in 
    literature, considered further options, and proposed that the MS was completed on 
    Sunday, July 29, 1543.

\section{Editorial Principles}
\subsection{Method}

The data for the critical edition comes from the witnesses of the Nepalese
version, described above. Diplomatic transcriptions of SS 1.16 of these
manuscripts have been created by researchers of the
\href{https://sushrutaproject.org}{Suśruta
    Project}\space%\footnote{https://sushrutaproject.org, accessed 20/8/2021.}
according to a subset of TEI Guidelines that has been formulated by Charles
Li.\footnote{These guidelines are at \url{https://saktumiva.org/wiki/tei},
accessed 20/10/2021.} MS NAK 5-333 was transcribed first because its script is
relatively easy to read, the scans are clear, and it is the most complete of
the manuscript witnesses. Following that, MS KL 699 and MS NAK 1-1079 were
transcribed.

The diplomatic transcriptions were uploaded to Li's manuscript collation platform
Saktumiva, chapter by chapter as they were completed. An electronic edition of the
vulgate of the \SS, that was transcribed, without the commentaries, by Tsutomu
Yamashita and Yasutaka Muroya on the basis of Ācārya's 1931 and 1938 Bombay
editions has also been included in the collation.\footnote{This electronic edition
is also available on the SARIT website;
\url{https://sarit.indology.info/susrutasamhita.xml?view=div}, accessed
20/8/2021. The version at Saktumiva has received several corrections and the intention is 
to merge these back into the SARIT version eventually.}

Saktumiva's  collation function standardises punctuation and 
orthographic variants according to filters which can be turned off or on. These 
filters enable the editors to ignore \dev{daṇḍa}, numbers and 
\dev{puṣpikā} in the transcripts, as well as orthographic variants, such as 
\dev{ba} and \dev{va}, certain germinated consonants, and \dev{visarga} 
variants. On the basis of the automatic collation, Jason Birch created a provisional 
edition of SS.1.16, which the project's researchers read together at weekly 
seminars. Manuscript images were routinely checked to verify the transcripts, 
particularly when a reading was uncertain; the commentaries of Cakrapāṇidatta 
and Ḍalhaṇa were read, and variant readings reported by these commentators 
were included in notes to the edition. Also, various reference books were 
consulted, such as   \citet{josi-maha,nadk-1954} and \citet{meul-hist}, to 
elucidate the meaning of technical terms and identify relevant information in 
other medical works. 

An initial draft of the translation and many annotations were written by  
Wujastyk during the seminars as the Project researchers discussed the text's 
meaning. The transcripts, provisional edition and translation were uploaded to the 
project's repository at Github on a weekly basis. Therefore, the project's work has 
been publicly available as it evolves. The software tools used in the project have been 
described on the project website.\footnote{\url{http://sushrutaproject.org}, consulted

\subsection{Stemma}
The data from transcripts collated by Saktumiva can be exported as a FASTA file 
and aligned according to characters, syllables or words by a program called 
Helayo. The resulting NEXUS file can be read by phylogenetics software to build a 
stemmatic tree.\footnote{This process is discussed in greater detail by Charles Li 
at \url{https://chchch.github.io/sanskrit-alignment/docs/index.html\#tree}, 
accessed 21/8/2021.} This procedure was done with transcripts of several 
chapters of the Nepalese witnesses, and the results confirmed the editors' 
provisional stemmatic hypothesis that 
K and H are more closely related to one another than K and N.\footnote{See 
section `Features of the Manuscript Transmission' for further discussion of this.} 
Given the early date of K and the small number of other surviving witnesses of the 
Nepalese version, the relationship between the manuscripts at our disposal is 
reasonably clear and, in the case of SS.1.16, the manuscript data was largely 
confined to N and H owing to a missing folio of K. Rather than have to assess 
numerous variant readings from a large number of witnesses, the challenge of 
editing has 
been to repair the text where it has become corrupt in the few witnesses available 
to us. 

\subsection{The Edition and Apparatus}

The critical edition of SS.1.16 in this article retains many of the peculiarities of MS 
KL 699 because the editors have endeavoured to present to the reader an 
archetype of the text that was transmitted by this ninth-century manuscript. 
Therefore, the Sanskrit has been standardised as minimally as possible and, 
although the text has been corrected and repaired wherever it was corrupt in the 
witnesses, it has not been normalized or conventionalized to the extent of many 
modern editions of Sanskrit works. 

The editors have assumed that the authors of the Nepalese \SS\ were familiar 
with Pāṇinian Sanskrit and, although there are some non-standard spellings and 
grammatical forms in the text, there are very few instances of 
hyper-Sanskritization, Buddhist-hybrid Sanskrit or Epic forms that would suggest 
that this assumption is unreasonable. Therefore, the editors of SS.1.16 have 
opted to retain some unusual features of the Sanskrit in MS KL 699 when they are 
grammatically correct. For example, in external \emph{sandhi}, the class nasal is 
usually used at the end of a word instead of an \emph{anusvāra} (e.g.,1.16.3, 
\dev{°vācanandhātry°}), although the \emph{anusvāra} is sometimes used 
(1.16.15, \dev{udakaṃ dhānyāmla°}). In most cases, the consonant following a 
\dev{repha} is doubled, but this is not always the case.\footnote{Examples of 
the germination of consonants are \dev{karṇṇa} (1.16.1 ff), \dev{muhūrtta} 
(1.16.2), \dev{pūrvva} (1.16.2), \dev{gandharvva} (1.16.5), \dev{°mūlair 
mmadhu°} (1.16.5), \dev{vartti} (1.16.6) and \dev{punarvvidhyet} (1.16.6). 
Examples where it does not occur in 1.16 are  \dev{°ārtham} (1.16.8,19), 
\dev{kuryāt} (1.16.16, 32), \dev{°pālirvallūra°} (1.16.10); \dev{°pālirvyāyojimaḥ} (1.16.10) 
and \dev{dīrghaika°} (1.16.10).} Since these 
inconsistencies seem inherent to the transmission of the text and may have even 
been authorial, the critical edition reflects them as they occur in K and, when the 
testimony of K is not available, the witness most similar to K, which is H.


% This is not always consistent: °ārtham (1.16.8,19), kuryāt (1.16.16, 32), °pālir 
%vallūra°  (1.16.10); °pālir vyāyojimaḥ (1.16.10); dīrghaika° (1.16.10).

%vallūra°  (1.16.10); °pālir vyāyojimaḥ (1.16.10); dīrghaika° (1.16.10).

The Nepalese manuscripts often have an \emph{anusvāra} before a 
\dev{daṇḍa} at the end of a sentence or verse. Whether these 
\emph{anusvāra}s should be changed to the consonant \dev{m} is a moot 
question because there is no Pāṇinian concept of `end-of-sentence' and his rules 
on \emph{sandhi} are contingent on the close contact of  sounds 
(\emph{saṃhitā})\q{refs?}. However, it is reasonable to assume that at the end 
of a verse, paragraph or sentence the speakers would have paused for breath or 
thought, so \emph{sandhi} should be applied, in which case a final 
\emph{anusvāra} or class nasal of the following consonant is changed to 
\dev{m}.  Nonetheless, this remains an assumption about how the text would 
be pronounced. Therefore, in a critical edition, inserting \emph{daṇḍa}s and 
changing \emph{anusvāra}s to \dev{m} before them are subjective decisions 
by the editors. The scribal use of \emph{daṇḍa}s and \emph{anusvāra}s in the 
Nepalese manuscripts can be seen in the digital edition if one switches off the 
filters for ignoring \emph{daṇḍa}s and final \emph{anusvāra} variants. 

Unconventional spellings and grammatical forms have been retained and noted in 
the annotations to the translation. However, the editors have corrected scribal 
errors and repaired corruptions in the transmitted text with conjectures wherever 
possible. Therefore, although the edition retains many of the peculiarities of the 
Nepalese manuscripts, it is not a diplomatic transcript or a hybrid of diplomatic 
and critical editing because the features of the transmitted text have been 
retained or changed deliberately, and the reasons for doing so are given in either 
the introduction or, in more specific cases, the annotations to the translation.

\subsection{Digital Edition}
The editors are producing both printed and digital editions of the Nepalese 
\SS. Since the print and digital environments differ markedly, each edition has 
its own format. 

Instructions for reading the digital edition have been provided by  Li at 
\href{https://saktumiva.org/wiki/users}{Saktumiva}. In brief, you can 
generate the apparatus by choosing a base text and one or more of the other 
witnesses. You can also choose to hide or ignore in varying degrees TEI 
tags, punctuation and orthographical variants in the transcripts of the witnesses. 
On the right side of the text, the digital edition displays an apparatus that is 
negative in so far as the lemma and its witnesses are not included. This apparatus 
intelligently truncates variants wher possible. 

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    %\includegraphics[draft=false, width=\textwidth]{media/SS.1.16.3b}
    \includegraphics[draft=false,width=.5\textwidth]{media/SS.1.16.3c}

    \caption{The digital edition of SS.1.16.3}
    \label{SS.1.16}
\end{figure}
For example, as seen in Figure~\ref{SS.1.16}, the apparatus for the words 
\emph{pratanuṃ sūcyā bahalam ārayā} is on the right side of the display. 
This entry means that the editors have chosen to read 
\emph{pratanuṃ}, which the reader must infer is attested by K, whereas A has 
\emph{tataḥ} and N and H \emph{pratanū}. Witness A has added the word 
\emph{picuvartiṃ} after \emph{tataḥ}, omitted \emph{sūcyā bahalam },\footnote{The 
omitted words are displayed by hovering the cursor over [OM] adjacent to A in the 
apparatus.} and has \emph{praveśayet} instead of \emph{ārayā}, which is attested by all 
of the Nepalese witnesses. 

A popup on a dark background, as shown in Figure~\ref{SS.1.16}, displays the
manuscript sigla for the witnesses that support the selected reading, which is
labelled “NE” (“New Edition”). As seen in Figure~\ref{SS.1.16.3}, the positive
apparatus of \emph{pratanuṃ sūcyā bahalam ārayā} appears in a pop-up window in
which the lemma and variants are aligned according to letters, and the variations
are highlighted in yellow. The positive apparatus can be expanded by highlighting
one or more words, and even entire passages or verses, and clicking on the
collapsed menu icon.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[draft=false,width=.7\textwidth]{media/SS.1.16b.positive}
    \caption{The witnesses to a selected passage of SS.1.16.3}
    \label{SS.1.16.3}
\end{figure}

In both the negative and positive apparatuses of the digital edition, you must
infer conjectures and corrections by the editors. Testimonia and notes are in the
apparatus on the right side of the “provisional edition” text.  They give an
opportunity for the editors to provide scholarly commentary of various kinds, but
the editors cannot write comments directly into the textual apparatus itself,
since it is constructed live each time the text is displayed.

\subsection{Printed Edition}

The printed edition of SS.1.16 in this article has four layers of footnotes. The
first layer reports the witnesses that have been collated. Line numbers and
lemmata have been used to identify the witnesses that have been collated for a
particular section of the text, as seen in the following example.
\begin{quote}
    \dev{1–7 athātaḥ – °viddhaliṅgam} ] MSS K, H, and N
\end{quote}
The above entry means that a textual passage beginning with \dev{athātaḥ} on line 1 and 
ending with \dev{°viddhaliṅgam} on line 7 is attested by manuscripts K, H and N. This layer 
also indicates passages that are missing or omitted in a particular witness. 

The second layer of footnotes reports the variant readings of the Nepalese witnesses. This 
apparatus is negative, that is to say, only the testimony of the variant readings have been 
reported, and not that of the lemma. The following entry is an example of the apparatus' 
syntax:
\begin{quote}
    \dev{5 pratanuṃ ]  pratanū} N H 
\end{quote}
This entry means that on line five of the edition the editors have chosen to read 
\dev{pratanuṃ}\,, instead of \dev{pratanū}\,, which is attested by witnesses N and H. The 
reader can infer that \dev{pratanuṃ} is attested by K because the first layer of footnotes 
indicate that K has been collated here. In prose passages, the lemmata and 
variants consist of corresponding words and, in verses, corresponding syllables. 
Emendations by the editors are indicated by the abbreviation \emph{em}., and omissions 
and suppletions in the witnesses are indicated by \emph{om.} and \emph{add}., 
respectively. A wavy line under a letter means that it is unclear to the editors. If some text 
has been deleted by a scribe, it is underscored by double lines, and the scribe's 
substitution is appended in quotation marks.  

There are small notational variations between the online digital edition and the
printed edition presented here.  For example, a scribal “crow's foot” mark
(\dev{kākapada}), often indicating a marginal insertion, is displayed as
$$\includegraphics[draft=false,width=.15\linewidth]{media/ane-online}$$ in the
digital edition, and as 
$$\includegraphics[draft=false,width=.24\linewidth]{media/ane-printed}$$ in
print.

%\end{figure}

The third layer of footnotes contains the variant readings of the vulgate, which have been 
presented in the same format as the second layer. If a reading of the vulgate has been 
accepted by the editors against different readings in the Nepalese witnesses, the siglum for 
the vulgate (i.e., A) has been placed next to lemma in the second layer of footnotes. 

The fourth layer of footnotes notes includes various testimonia and notes. The
testimonia mainly consists of the variant readings noted by the commentators
Cakrapāṇidatta and Ḍalhaṇa. Those known to Gayadāsa may be added in future
publications. The notes include brief comments on certain emendations and
editorial decisions. More elaborate discussions on such issues have been included
in the annotations to the translation.

In the printed edition below, the numbering of passages has been adjusted to
follow the text of the Nepalese version of the work.  The numbering of the
corresponding passages in the vulgate is presented in small digits in the
right margin.
