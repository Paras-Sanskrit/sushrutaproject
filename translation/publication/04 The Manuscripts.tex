\chapter{The Manuscripts}

Our edition is based on the textual evidence of three manuscripts.  All
three were produced in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal and preserved in
libraries there. \textcites[\S 2.1]{kleb-2021b} provided a comprehensive
description of the individual manuscripts, quotes and translates their
colophons and thoroughly examines various problems involved in their
interpretation.\footnote{See also \cite{hari-2010,hari-2011,hari-2014}.}
    That is why we will present only the key data essential for the study of our
    edition in the present book. In referring to the manuscripts, we use the
    sigla K, N and H, which correspond to the initial letters in the names of
    the libraries or owners, and have become canonical.

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item[\textbf{K}] \MS{Kathmandu KL 699} (fig.\,\ref{fig:017r-img0065})
is preserved at the \textbf{K}aiser Shamsher (KL) library in
Kathmandu.\footnote{See also the description by \citet[\S
    2.1]{kleb-2021b}.}  It was microfilmed and catalogued by the NGMPP/
    NGMCP as C 80-7.\footnote{See the description in the online NGMCP
        catalogue, \cite{kh-c807}.} The MS comprises 152 palm-leaf folios that
        originally belonged to several different codicological units written by
        different scribes.\footnote{ \textcites[46]{bhat-2020} and
            \textcites[11]{kleb-2021b} agree that four to five scribes were involved
            in the manuscript's production.} The folios are 53.5 $\times$ 4.4 cm in
            size and have two string holes.  The text is written in the so-called
            transitional Gupta script, with six to eight lines per
            folio.\footnote{Codicological features of the manuscript, including the
                layout, peculiarities of the script, and various ornamental and
                text-dividing symbols were studied in \textcites{bhat-2020}.} The MS is
                incomplete and contains a large part of the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} as
                well as the \emph{Sauśrutanighaṇṭu}.\footnote{\textcite[11]{kleb-2021b}
                    provided a detailed description of the content.} The date stated in the
                    colophon at the end of the compendium is verified for Sunday, April 13,
                    878 \CE. However, physical damage to the manuscript folio containing 
                    the
                    colophon means that it is no longer possible to interpret it
                    definitively.  In particular, two persons are mentioned in the
                    concluding remarks, someone called Śrī Harṣacandra and Vaidya
                    Vasuvarman, but their roles are not perfectly clear.
                    \textcites[16]{kleb-2021b} thinks that the former,
    \begin{quote}
        \ldots either sponsored the copying enterprise or wrote the manuscript himself,
        [and that he subsequently] donated it to Vaidya Vasuvarman on the condition that
        he (Vasuvarman) would study the text and explain it to others. The second
        condition was that the manuscript should remain in the family and not be given
        away either for sale or as a pawn. If the manuscript sat unused, it should be
        returned to Śrī Harṣacandra.\footnote{\textcite[13--17]{kleb-2021b} provided a
        translation and study of the colophon, as well as an exposition of different
        positions related to its interpretation.}

    \item[\textbf{N}]  \MS{Kathmandu NAK 1-1079}
(fig.\,\ref{fig:a45-0573274044}) is kept at the \textbf{N}ational
Archives Kathmandu (NAK), under accession number
1/1079\,\dev{ka}.\footnote{See also the description by \citet[\S
    2.2]{kleb-2021b}.}  It was microfilmed twice by the NGMPP as A 45-5(1)
    and A 1267-11(2),\footnote{See the description in the NGMCP database by
        \citet{acha-a45-5}.}.  In 2023 the project was able to purchase
        higher-quality colour digital images of the manuscript from the NAK. The
        manuscript comprises 65 palm-leaf folios, 56$\times$5\,cm in size, with
        two string holes each, and it is bundled together in a composite
        manuscript with at least one other medical work. The text is written in
        a variety of Newari scripts, with seven lines per folio on average.
        Although the text contained in the manuscript does not cover the entire
        \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} and breaks off abruptly in the second chapter of
        the \emph{śārīrasthāna}, the actual MS, as a codicological unit, appears
        complete, that is, no leaf seems to be missing from the originally
        unitary artefact. Based on paleographic considerations, the manuscript
        can be dated tentatively to the twelfth or thirteenth century.

    \goodbreak \item[\textbf{H}]  \MS{Kathmandu NAK 5-333} 
    (fig.\,\ref{fig:dscn2998-fol-022cropped}) formerly belonged
to the historical collection of \textbf{H}emarāja Śarman (fl.\
1878--1953).\footnote{See also the description by \citet[\S
    2.3]{kleb-2021b}.} It is
    now held by the National Archives Kathmandu and was microfilmed twice by
    the NGMPP as B 29-19 and B 30-15, but the latter microfilm is
    incomplete.\footnote{ See the NGMCP description by \citet{ak-b29-19}.}
        The manuscript comprises 435 palm-leaf folios, $34\times5$\,cm in size,
        with one string-hole left of centre. It is written in a type of Newari
        script that is more recent than that of N, with approximately six lines
        per folio. The manuscript is exceptionally well preserved.  Of vital
        value for the present project, the manuscript supports the complete \SS\
        and the \emph{Sauśrutanighaṇṭu}. The final colophon identifies the
        scribe of the manuscript as Vaidya Amarasiṃhaka, son of Kamaladatta, and
        states the date on which he concluded the copying of the text. Both
        reading the colophon, that is, deciphering the actual characters, and
        the interpretation of the concerned passage involve diverging opinions,
        all of which concur, however, in assigning the MS to the sixteenth
        century. \textcite[21--26]{kleb-2021b} gave an analytical account of the
        views expressed in literature, considered further options, and proposed
        that the MS was completed on Sunday, July 29, 1543.

\section{Editorial Principles}
\subsection{Method}

The data for the critical edition comes from the witnesses of the Nepalese
version, described above. Diplomatic transcriptions of SS 1.16 of these
manuscripts have been created by researchers of the
\href{https://sushrutaproject.org}{Suśruta Project} according to a subset of
TEI Guidelines that has been formulated by Charles Li and tailored for the
Saktumiva platform.\footnote{See \cite{wuja-2021c}, \cite{tei-p5} and \cite[
    “TEI Tagging”]{li-2017a}.} \MScite{Kathmandu NAK 5-333} was transcribed first
    because its script is relatively easy to read, the scans are clear, it is the
    most complete of the manuscript witnesses, and its text is extremely close to
    that of \MScite{Kathmandu KL 699}. Following that, \MScite{Kathmandu KL 699}
    and \MScite{Kathmandu NAK 1-1079} were transcribed.

The diplomatic transcriptions were uploaded to Li's manuscript collation
platform called Saktumiva, chapter by chapter as they were
completed.\footnote{See the Saktumiva interface \cite{li-2017a}.} An
    electronic edition of the vulgate of the \SS, that was transcribed, without
    the commentaries, by Tsutomu Yamashita and Yasutaka Muroya on the basis of
    Ācārya's 1931 and 1938 Bombay editions has also been included on the Saktumiva
    platform and is available for collation.\footnote{This electronic edition is
        also available on the SARIT website \citep[sub “Suśrutasaṃhitā”]{wuja-2008}. The 
        version at
        Saktumiva has received several corrections and the intention is to merge these
        back into the SARIT edition eventually.}

Saktumiva's  collation function standardises punctuation and orthographic
variants according to filters which can be turned off or on.\footnote{On the
    rationale for implementing text-critical principles as algorithms, see
    \cite{li-2017} and \cite[\S 4.4]{li-2018}.} These filters enable the editors to ignore
    \emph{daṇḍa}s, numbers and floral punctuation marks (\emph{puṣpikā}) in the
    transcripts, as well as orthographic variants, such as \dev{ba} and \dev{va},
    certain germinated consonants, and \emph{visarga} variants. On the basis of
    the automatic collation, Jason Birch created a provisional edition of SS.1.16,
    which the project's researchers read together at weekly seminars. Manuscript
    images were routinely checked to verify the transcripts, particularly when a
    reading was uncertain; the commentaries of Cakrapāṇidatta and Ḍalhaṇa were
    read, and variant readings reported by these commentators were included in
    notes to the edition. Also, various reference books were consulted, to
    elucidate the meaning of technical terms and identify relevant information in
    other medical works.\footnote{Particularly valuable reference resources
        included \citet{josi-maha}, \citet{meul-hist}, and the literature on
        materia medica cited on pp.\,\pageref{botanicalsourcebooks}\,ff.\ below.}

An initial draft of the translation and many annotations were written by
Wujastyk during the seminars as the Project researchers discussed the text's
meaning. The transcripts, provisional edition and translation were uploaded to
the project's repository at Github on a weekly basis.\footcite{wuja-2021c}
Therefore, the project's work has been publicly available as it evolves. The
software tools used in the project have been described on the project
website.\footcite[“The toolbox”]{wuja-2021b}

\subsection{Stemma} The data from transcripts collated by Saktumiva can be
exported as a FASTA file and aligned according to characters, syllables or
words by a program called Helayo.\footcite{li-2022} The resulting NEXUS file
can be read by phylogenetic software to build a stemmatic tree.\footnote{This
    process is discussed in greater detail by \citet{li-2022b}.} This procedure was done 
    with transcripts of several
    chapters of the Nepalese witnesses, and the results confirmed the editors'
    preliminary stemmatic hypothesis that K and H are more closely related to one
    another than K and N.\footnote{See chapter \ref{transmission} above
         for further discussion.} Given the early date of K and
        the small number of other surviving witnesses of the Nepalese version, the
        relationship between the manuscripts at our disposal is reasonably clear and,
        in the case of SS.1.16, the manuscript data was largely confined to N and H
        owing to a missing folio of K. Rather than have to assess numerous variant
        readings from a large number of witnesses, the challenge of editing has been
        to repair the text where it has become corrupt in the few witnesses available
        to us.

\subsection{The Edition and Apparatus}

The critical edition of SS.1.16 in this article retains many of the
peculiarities of \MScite{Kathmandu KL 699} because the editors have
endeavoured to present to the reader a hyparchetype of the text that was
transmitted by this ninth-century manuscript. Therefore, the Sanskrit has been
standardised as little as possible and, although the text has been corrected
and repaired wherever it was corrupt in the witnesses, it has not been
normalized or conventionalized to the extent of many modern editions of
Sanskrit works.

The editors have assumed that the authors of the Nepalese \SS\ were familiar
with Pāṇinian Sanskrit and, although there are some non-standard spellings and
grammatical forms in the text, there are very few instances of
hyper-Sanskritization, Buddhist-Hybrid Sanskrit or Epic forms that would
suggest that this assumption is unreasonable.\footnote{On the contrary, the
    text of the \SS\ sometimes retains legitimate Pāṇinian forms that are rare or
    unknown elsewhere in Sanskrit literature.  For example, the term
    \emph{kārmuka} “effective,” formed by P.5.1.103, is virtually unknown in
    classical Sanskrit, and is said even by the authors of the \emph{Kāśikāvṛtti}
    to occur uniquely as an adjective describing a bow.  Yet it occurs in both the
    \SS\ (\Su{1.41.5}{182}) and the \CS\ (\Ca{1.26.13}{138}), describing
    “effective” drug substances.   Cf.\ the observation by \citet[118]{desh-1988}
    that other rare Pāṇinian usages in the early Sanskrit medical texts provide
    evidence that, “\ldots\ in all likelihood there was a dialect of Sanskrit
    closer to Pāṇini's time and region in which [such peculiar Pāṇinian usage
    existed]. This peculiarity did not exist in most other dialects of Sanskrit.”}
    Therefore, the editors of SS.1.16 have opted to retain some perhaps unfamiliar
    features of the Sanskrit in \MScite{Kathmandu KL 699} when they are
    grammatically correct. For example, in external \emph{sandhi}, the class nasal
    is usually used at the end of a word instead of an \emph{anusvāra}
    (e.g.,1.16.3, \dev{°vācanandhātry°}), although the \emph{anusvāra} is
    sometimes used (1.16.15, \dev{udakaṃ dhānyāmla°}). In most cases, the
    consonant following a \dev{repha} is doubled, but this is not always the
    case.\footnote{Examples of the germination of consonants are \dev{karṇṇa}
        (1.16.1 ff), \dev{muhūrtta} (1.16.2), \dev{pūrvva} (1.16.2), \dev{gandharvva}
        (1.16.5), \dev{°mūlair mmadhu°} (1.16.5), \dev{vartti} (1.16.6) and
        \dev{punarvvidhyet} (1.16.6). Examples where it does not occur in 1.16 are
        \dev{°ārtham} (1.16.8,19), \dev{kuryāt} (1.16.16, 32), \dev{°pālirvallūra°}
        (1.16.10); \dev{°pālirvyāyojimaḥ} (1.16.10) and \dev{dīrghaika°} (1.16.10).}
        Since these inconsistencies seem inherent to the transmission of the text and
        may have even been authorial, the critical edition reflects them as they occur
        in K and, when the testimony of K is not available, the witness most similar
        to K, which is H.


% This is not always consistent: °ārtham (1.16.8,19), kuryāt (1.16.16, 32), °pālir 
%vallūra°  (1.16.10); °pālir vyāyojimaḥ (1.16.10); dīrghaika° (1.16.10).

% germination of consonants after a repha, even between words.
% karṇṇa (1.16.1 ff), muhūrtta (1.16.2), pūrvva (1.16.2), gandharvva (1.16.5), 
%°mūlair mmadhu° (1.16.5), vartti (1.16.6), punar vvidhyet (1.16.6), °pālir 
%nnirvvedhimaḥ
% This is not always consistent: °ārtham (1.16.8,19), kuryāt (1.16.16, 32), °pālir 
%vallūra°  (1.16.10); °pālir vyāyojimaḥ (1.16.10); dīrghaika° (1.16.10).

The Nepalese manuscripts often have an \emph{anusvāra} before a \emph{daṇḍa}
at the end of a sentence or verse. Whether these \emph{anusvāra}s should be
changed to the consonant \dev{m} is a moot question because there is no formal
Pāṇinian concept of `end-of-sentence' and his rules on \emph{sandhi} are
contingent on the close contact of  sounds (\emph{saṃhitā}).\footnote{Pāṇini
    1.4.109 \dev{paraḥ sannikarṣaḥ saṃhitā}, \emph{et passim}.} However, it is
    reasonable to assume that at the end of a verse, paragraph or sentence the
    speakers would have paused for breath or thought, so \emph{sandhi} should be
    applied, in which case a final \emph{anusvāra} or class nasal of the following
    consonant is changed to \dev{m}.  Nonetheless, this remains an assumption
    about how the text would be pronounced. Therefore, in a critical edition,
    inserting \emph{daṇḍa}s and changing \emph{anusvāra}s to \dev{m} before them
    are subjective decisions by the editors. The scribal use of \emph{daṇḍa}s and
    \emph{anusvāra}s in the Nepalese manuscripts can be seen in the digital
    edition if one switches off the filters for ignoring \emph{daṇḍa}s and final
    \emph{anusvāra} variants.

Unconventional spellings and grammatical forms have been retained and noted in 
the annotations to the translation. However, the editors have corrected scribal 
errors and repaired corruptions in the transmitted text with conjectures wherever 
possible. Therefore, although the edition retains many of the peculiarities of the 
Nepalese manuscripts, it is not a diplomatic transcript or a hybrid of diplomatic 
and critical editing because the features of the transmitted text have been 
retained or changed deliberately, and the reasons for doing so are given in either 
the introduction or, in more specific cases, the annotations to the translation.

\subsection{Digital Edition}
The editors are producing both printed and digital editions of the Nepalese 
\SS. Since the print and digital environments differ markedly, each edition has 
its own format. 

Instructions for reading the digital edition have been provided by  Li at 
\href{https://saktumiva.org/wiki/users}{Saktumiva}. In brief, you can 
generate the apparatus by choosing a base text and one or more of the other 
witnesses. You can also choose to hide or ignore in varying degrees TEI 
tags, punctuation and orthographical variants in the transcripts of the witnesses. 
On the right side of the text, the digital edition displays an apparatus that is 
negative in so far as the lemma and its witnesses are not included. This apparatus 
intelligently truncates variants where possible. 

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    %\includegraphics[draft=false, width=\textwidth]{media/SS.1.16.3b}
    \includegraphics[draft=false,width=.5\textwidth]{media/SS.1.16.3c}
    \quad
    \includegraphics[draft=false,width=.35\textwidth]{media/SS.1.16.3d}
    \caption{The digital edition of SS.1.16.3}
    \label{SS.1.16}
\end{figure}
For example, as seen in Figure~\ref{SS.1.16}, the apparatus for the words
\emph{pratanuṃ sūcyā bahalam ārayā} is on the right side of the display.
This entry means that the editors have chosen to read \emph{pratanuṃ}, which
the reader must infer is attested by K, whereas A has \emph{tataḥ} and N and
H \emph{pratanū}. Witness A has added the word \emph{picuvartiṃ} after
\emph{tataḥ}, omitted \emph{sūcyā bahalam},\footnote{The omitted words are
    displayed by hovering the cursor over [OM] adjacent to A in the apparatus.}
    and has \emph{praveśayet} instead of \emph{ārayā}, which is attested by all
    of the Nepalese witnesses.

A popup on a dark background, as shown in Figure~\ref{SS.1.16}, displays the
manuscript sigla for the witnesses that support the selected reading, which is
labelled “NE” (“New Edition”). As seen in Figure~\ref{SS.1.16.3}, the positive
apparatus of \emph{pratanuṃ sūcyā bahalam ārayā} appears in a pop-up window in
which the lemma and variants are aligned according to letters, and the variations
are highlighted in yellow. The positive apparatus can be expanded by highlighting
one or more words, and even entire passages or verses, and clicking on the
collapsed menu icon.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[draft=false,width=.7\textwidth]{media/SS.1.16b.positive}
    \caption{The witnesses to a selected passage of SS.1.16.3}
    \label{SS.1.16.3}
\end{figure}

In both the negative and positive apparatuses of the digital edition, you must
infer conjectures and corrections by the editors. Testimonia and notes are in the
apparatus on the right side of the “provisional edition” text.  They give an
opportunity for the editors to provide scholarly commentary of various kinds, but
the editors cannot write comments directly into the textual apparatus itself,
since it is constructed live each time the text is displayed.

The digital form of the edition is “soft,” in the sense that editorial work on
the files that generate the critical text is potentially continuous, adding
ever greater refinement and precision.  And, especially, as more manuscript
witnesses come to light and are transcribed, the edition is open to continuous
enrichment.

\subsection{Printed Edition}

The printed edition of SS.1.16 has four layers of footnotes. The
first layer reports the witnesses that have been collated. Line numbers and
lemmata have been used to identify the witnesses that have been collated for a
particular section of the text, as seen in the following example on p.\,47:
\begin{quote}
    \dev{1–9 athātaḥ – °viddhaliṅgam} ] MSS K, H, and N
\end{quote}
The above entry means that a textual passage beginning with \dev{athātaḥ} on
line 1 and ending with \dev{°viddhaliṅgam} on line 9 is attested by
manuscripts K, H and N. This layer also indicates passages that are missing or
omitted in a particular witness.

The second layer of footnotes reports the variant readings of the Nepalese
witnesses. This apparatus is negative, that is to say, only the testimony of
the variant readings have been reported, and not that of the lemma. The
following entry is an example of the apparatus' syntax, on p.\,47:
\begin{quote}
    \dev{6 pratanuṃ ]  pratanū} N H 
\end{quote}
This entry means that on line six of the edition the editors have chosen to
read \dev{pratanuṃ}\,, instead of \dev{pratanū}\,, which is attested by
witnesses N and H. The reader can infer that \dev{pratanuṃ} is attested by K
because the first layer of footnotes indicates that K has been collated here.
In prose passages, the lemmata and variants consist of corresponding words
and, in verses, corresponding syllables. Emendations by the editors are
indicated by the abbreviation \emph{em.}, and omissions and suppletions in the
witnesses are indicated by \emph{om.} and \emph{add}., respectively. A wavy
line under a letter means that it is unclear to the editors. Text deleted by a
scribe is shown underscored by double lines, and the scribe's substitution is
appended in quotation marks.

There are minor notational variations between the online digital edition and the
printed edition presented here.  For example, a scribal “crow's foot” mark
(\dev{kākapada}), often indicating a marginal insertion, is displayed in the digital 
edition as,
\begin{quote}
    \includegraphics[draft=false,width=.19\linewidth]{media/ane-online}
    \end{quote}
and in print as
\begin{quote}
    \includegraphics[draft=false,width=.24\linewidth]{media/ane-printed}
    \end{quote}

The third layer of footnotes contains the variant readings of the vulgate,
which have been presented in the same format as the second layer. If a reading
of the vulgate has been accepted by the editors against different readings in
the Nepalese witnesses, the siglum for the vulgate (i.e., A) has been placed
next to lemma in the second layer of footnotes.

The fourth layer of footnotes notes includes various testimonia and notes. The
testimonia mainly consists of the variant readings noted by the commentators
Cakrapāṇidatta and Ḍalhaṇa. Those known to Gayadāsa may be added in future
publications. The notes include brief comments on certain emendations and
editorial decisions. More elaborate discussions on such issues have been included
in the annotations to the translation.

In the printed edition below, the numbering of passages has been adjusted to
follow the text of the Nepalese version of the work.  The numbering of the
corresponding passages in the vulgate is presented in small digits in the
right margin.
