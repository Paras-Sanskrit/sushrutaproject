Preface
The Compendium of Suśruta (Sanskrit: Suśrutasaṃhitā) is a world classic of
ancient medicine, comparable in age and importance to the Hippocratic
Corpus and the Huangdi Neijing. It is a substantial treatise, written in the
Sanskrit language, that presents a systematic, scholarly form of medicine
for diagnosing and treating the many ailments that patients presented in
South Asia two thousand years ago. The Compendium is a text written by
physicians for physicans and is one of the founding treatises of the indigenous medical system of India, Ayurveda. As such, it still informs indigenous
medical practice in India and Ayurvedic complementary and alternative
medicine internationally.
Amongst historians of medicine, The Compendium is perhaps most famous for its passages describing remarkable forms of surgery. These techniques were used in South Asia and beyond: The Compendium’s method
of couching for cataract circulated in China in the seventh century and a
form of facial plastic surgery described in The Compendium was witnessed
by British surgeons in India in the eighteenth century and subsequently
formed the basis of certain types of facial reconstruction as practised even
today.
In 2007, a previously unknown manuscript of The Compendium from
the uncatalogued collections of the Kaiser Library in Kathmandu was announced in a scholarly publication. This manuscript, MS Kathmandu KL
699, is datable to 878 ce, almost a thousand years before any other known
manuscript of the work. Furthermore, it became clear that two other manuscripts in Kathmandu were close copies of KL 699, albeit from later dates.
These exciting discoveries provide a time machine by which we can
directly examine the medical thought of Nepalese physicians of the ninth
century. We can also start to see the changes and additions to the text that
have happened in the last millennium. Almost all of these later changes
v

vi
to the text have tended to obscure its clarity and directness, banalizing the
language and inflating the recipes. Through the critical study of MS Kathmandu KL 699 and its companions we are beginning to recover an older,
more authentic and more meaningful version of this medical classic.
This book presents a single chapter from The Compendium that is of
unique interest to medical history. The book also lays out the basic parameters and methods of the project that will also apply to future publications. The members of the Suśruta Project have already read, edited and
translated several other chapters. These materials are already available in
digital format through the project website.1 It is our intention to continue
to publish both digitally and in print. We are currently preparing a critical edition and annotated translation of the Kalpasthāna, The Compendium’s
book on plant and animal poisons and their remedies.
Beyond the present funded project, the important work of editing and
translating the other five books of the treatise remains for the future. Therefore the present book aims to establish an academically sound model for
disseminating this older version of The Compendium to an international
audience that will pave the way for future editions of the rest of the work.
When one sees an authorial collaboration such as the present book, it
is natural to be curious about who did what. The bulk of the words of
this book were co-written by myself and Jason Birch. Andrey Klebanov
contributed an important section describing the manuscripts; Madhu K.
Paramesvaran wrote about the evolution of recipes through time. The text
of the translation was a fully collaborative effort, arising out of weekly
seminar meetings that we all attended and to which we all contributed.
Usually, Jason or I would present a first draft, and that was discussed
word by word, together with re-visiting difficult manuscript readings and
refining the critical edition. Additionally, Vandana Lele, Harshal Bhatt,
Madhusudan Rimal and Deepro Chakraborty and Paras Mehta all spent
many hours carefully transcribing the old Nepalese manuscripts so that
the text could be edited using the methods of Digital Humanities. The
book could not have been written without the participation of the whole
project team.
I would like to thank other project participants who have also contributed to the project at different times, including Jane Allred, Devayani
Shenoy and Gauri Vyaghrambhare.

1 Introduction
The Compendium of Suśruta (Suśrutasaṃhitā) is amongst the most important treatises on medicine to survive from the ancient world. It has been
studied seriously by historians since it first became available in print in the
mid-nineteenth century.1 Meulenbeld listed forty-four editions of the work
since the first edition of 1835 by Gupta in Calcutta, and eight translations,
starting from the Latin translation of 1844 by Hessler.2 Many more translations have appeared in recent decades and reprints of the early twentiethcentury editions continue to be reprinted frequently.
The study of this work has yielded rich historical discoveries about the
earliest history of surgery, ancient pharmacology, toxicology and many
other social and medical topics. Yet there remain fundamental unanswered
questions about the history of the text itself and about related issues in the
history of medicine in Asia.3
In January 2007, a manuscript of the Suśrutasaṃhitā in the Kaiser
Library, Kathmandu, previously unknown to contemporary scholarship,
was brought to international attention by Dimitrov and Tamot.4 MS
Kathmandu KL 699 is a Nepalese palm-leaf manuscript covering about
two thirds of the Sanskrit text. It is dated to 878 ce, making it one of the
earliest dated manuscripts known from South Asia.5 The manuscript has
been declared by UNESCO to be part of the Memory of the World.6
The newly-discovered manuscript in Nepal is related to two other
early palm-leaf manuscripts in the National Archives in Kathmandu,

MS Kathmandu NAK 5-333 and MS Kathmandu NAK 1-1079. Klebanov
has assembled compelling evidence for believing that these Nepalese
manuscripts present a version of the text that was in wider circulation
in northern India, especially Bengal, in the period up to about 1200
ce.7 Generally speaking, the Nepalese version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā
is shorter and sometimes clearer than the versions commented on by
Cakrapāṇidatta (fl. eleventh century) and Ḍalhaṇa (fl. twelfth century).
The version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā commented on by Ḍalhaṇa has formed
the basis of modern printed editions and translations, such as those of
Yadavaśarman Trivikramātmaja Ācārya and others.8 Some of the changes
in the text between the Nepalese version and what we might call the
Ḍalhaṇa version, or the vulgate version,9 consist of the addition and
loss of numerous verses, changes to medical recipes, and reordering of
chapters, especially in the Uttaratantra or last part of the work. Lariviere
hypothesized long ago, in a different context, that Sanskrit texts tended to
continue to expand through the addition of new materials,
The process of addition to these compilations must have gone
on for centuries. The hearers or readers of of these compilations must have known other verses … and it would be natural
for them to include these verses in the compilation. This type
of addition may have continued until a commentary on the collection was composed. A commentary would have served to fix
the text. and the expansion of the text would have been more
difficult after that.10
In the case of the Suśrutasaṃhitā, the Nepalese manuscripts appear to
present us with the last recoverable snapshot of this stage of the work
when it was still open to absorbing new materials, most notably the
Uttaratantra, and before the text was fixed as a result of the authority of

the major commentators, Cakrapāṇidatta and Ḍalhaṇa.11 It is in this sense
that we use the expression, “Ḍalhaṇa’s version,” when referring to the
vulgate text of the Suśrutasaṃhitā.
The present study offers a critical edition and annotated translation of
the sixteenth chapter of the Ślokasthāna, the first book of the Nepalese version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā.12 This chapter is important in the history of Indian medicine because of its discussion of surgical methods for repairing
torn ears and severed noses. In addition to discussing the manuscripts and
published editions used in this new edition, the introduction of this study
addresses some of the challenges of editing the Nepalese manuscripts and
the salient differences between the Nepalese version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā
1.16 and the text as known to Cakrapāṇidatta and Ḍalhaṇa. The notes to the
edition incorporate alternative readings mentioned by the commentators.
The annotations to the translation discuss the following topics: instances
where the text is uncertain; non-standard spellings and syntax; the meaning of technical and obscure terms; relevant remarks by the commentators;
ambiguities in the identification of medical ingredients, in particular, plant
names; and the additional compounds, verses and passages in Ḍalhaṇa’s
version of the text. In short, this is a pilot study for undertaking a complete
edition and translation of the Nepalese version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā.

Importance of SS.1.16 in the History of Medicine
Simple forms of surgery have a long history in South Asia. In works datable to at least 1200 bce we learn how a reed was used as a catheter to
cure urine retention.13 Cauterization too was described in the same ancient
sources, to prevent wounds from bleeding. The Atharvaveda, in the early
first millennium bce, described the bones of the human body, showing
11 The roles of earlier commentators including Jejjaṭa, Gayadāsa and Candraṭa in closing the text and influencing Cakrapāṇidatta and Ḍalhaṇa remains an open research
problem.
12 This book is called the Sūtrasthāna in later versions of the Suśrutasaṃhitā. Note that
the Suśrutasaṃhitā itself used the name Ślokasthāna at several places, e.g., 6.42.61
(Su 1938: 721), 6.65.30 and 31 (Su 1938: 818), usually referring to identifiable passages
in that part of the work. The name is also used in the Ślokasthāna itself, at 1.1.40 of the
Nepalese version.

early anatomical awareness in a religious context.14 The Brāhmaṇa literature of the only slightly later period contained more detailed descriptions
of animal butchery in the context of religious sacrifice that involved the
enumeration of internal organs and bones.15 This exemplifies an early Sanskrit vocabulary for internal parts of bodies. However, this is not the same
as anatomical dissection, whose methods and intentions are quite different. As Keith pointed out long ago, the enumeration of the bones in the
Brāhmaṇas was derived from correspondences with the numbering of various verse forms, not from anatomical observation.16 With the Suśrutasaṃhitā, we find ourselves in the presence of something quite different and far
more sophisticated from the medical point of view, where the body was
studied specifically for medical and surgical purposes.17 The text gives us
a historical window onto a school of professionalised medicine, including
surgical practice, that existed almost two millennia ago and which in its
day was perhaps the most advanced school of surgery in the world.
The author of the Suśrutasaṃhitā described how a surgeon should
be trained and how various operations should be done. There are
descriptions of ophthalmic couching (the dislodging of the lens of the
eye), perineal lithotomy (cutting for stone in the bladder), the removal
of arrows and splinters, suturing, the examination of dead human bodies
for the study of anatomy, and other procedures.18 The author of the
Suśrutasaṃhitā claimed that surgery was the most ancient and most
efficacious of the eight branches of medical knowledge.19 Anecdotal
discussion with contemporary surgeons suggests that many details in the
descriptions could only have been written by a practising surgeon: it is
beyond reasonable doubt that elaborate surgical techniques were a reality
amongst those whose practices were recorded in the Suśrutasaṃhitā.20

traditional couching operations with his contemporary nineteenth-century methods

Torn ear lobes
The Suśrutasaṃhitā’s description of the repair of torn ear lobes is unique for
its time.21 Majno, a practising surgeon, noted that, “through the habit of
stretching their earlobes, the Indians became masters in a branch of surgery
that Europe ignored for another two thousand years”.22 The different types
of mutilated ear lobe that the Suśrutasaṃhitā described are not always easy
to understand from the Sanskrit: the illustrations supplied in Majno’s text
greatly help with the visualization of the most likely scenarios.23

Rhinoplasty
One of the best-known surgical techniques associated with Suśrutasaṃhitā
is rhinoplasty, the repair or rebuilding of a severed nose. The history of this
operation has been discussed by Wujastyk, and a translation of the Sanskrit passage from the vulgate edition of the Suśrutasaṃhitā was given.24
This fascinating technique is certainly old in South Asia, having been witnessed by travellers from Niccolo Manucci in the seventeenth century onwards.25 Many witnesses, including the most famous, Cruso and Findlay,26
described an operation that differs from Suśrutasaṃhitā in that it takes the
grafting skin from the forehead, not the cheek. But the nineteenth-century
operation witnessed by Thorburn is especially interesting, since the technique followed the Suśrutasaṃhitā exactly in taking flesh from the cheek,
rather than the forehead.27
As noted by Meulenbeld, none of the extant commentators – Jejjaṭa,
Gayadāsa, Cakrapāṇi or Ḍalhaṇa – explained the technique in any detail
(MS London Wellcome 3007).
21 The comprehensive study of ears in the history of Indian culture by Bollée (2010)
oddly omits reference to Suśrutasaṃhitā’s surgery, although it mentions the text’s description of ear diseases.

beyond short lexical glosses.28 This suggests that the commentators may
not all have known the technique at first-hand.

The skin flap
It is worth highlighting here a point of critical medical importance: the
continued attachment of the skin flap. One of the crucial innovations of the
“Hindu Method” of nasal reconstruction, as observed and internationally
reported in the eighteenth century, was that the skin flap taken from the
face remained partially connected to its original location.29 This ensured
the blood flow essential to keeping the skin alive while it healed in its new
location.30 The Sanskrit of the vulgate is ambiguous on this critical point
and the wording of the Nepalese version is unclear. However, Ḍalhaṇa
clarified the meaning of the vulgate here by stating that when reading the
expression “connected,” one should understand “connected flesh”.31 He
thus indicated that he understood the flesh to be connected to the face.32
Thus, we cannot know definitively at present whether the connection of
the flap was known to the redactors of the Nepalese version, although it
seems likely. It was probably known to the redactors of the vulgate, and
was certainly known to Ḍalhaṇa in the twelfth century.
Earlier in the chapter, in the context of ear-piercing and repair, the vulgate has a passage that is more explicit and conclusive. After listing the
names and characteristics of different types of earlobe, the vulgate cites
some summary verses from an unknown source.33 The last of these verses
says,
28 HIML: IB, 328. Ḍalhaṇa noted cryptically, on 1.16.27–31 (Su 1938: 81a), that a rather
different version of the text, cast in śloka metre, was also known to him from other
sources. Ḍalhaṇa’s variant bears a resemblance to the description of the operation
given in printed editions of the Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā at Utt.18.59–65 (Ah 1939: 841).
29 See Wujastyk 2003: 67–70.
30 This surgical innovation distinguished the “Hindu Method” from sixteenth-century
European methods associated with Gaspar Tagliacozzo and others (see, e.g., Carpue
1816: passim).
31 Suśrutasaṃhitā 1.16.28 (Su 1938: 81).
32 See p. 60 below.
33 1.16.11–14 (Su 1938: 78).

7
If no lobe exists, an expert may create an ear lobe by scarifying and then using living flesh still attached to the cheek from
which it has been sliced.34
The commentator Ḍalhaṇa was even more explicit in his gloss on this passage:
“Living” [flesh] means “together with blood”.35
Thus, Ḍalhaṇa’s comment gives us unequivocal evidence for the concept
of a living skin flap in the twelfth century, and it is almost certain that this
is also what the text of the Suśrutasaṃhitā intended by the word “living.”
The one remaining historical problem is that these specific verses, 1.16.11–
14, are not present in the Nepalese version of the text. This suggests that
they were part of a different tradition of practice with a verse literature that
was integrated into the vulgate text of the Suśrutasaṃhitā at a time after
the Nepalese version as recorded in 878 ce, but at the latest by the time of
Ḍalhaṇa in the twelfth century.
If we can assume that the descriptions of ear-surgery and rhinoplasty
were part of a single professional tradition of surgical method, then the
above passage, in the context of ear-lobe repair, strongly supports the idea
that rhinoplastic surgery too was conducted with attention to keeping a
living skin flap.
By the late first millennium, had the rhinoplastic technique moved
from the professional competence of scholar-physicians (vaidyas) to that
of barber-surgeons (Ambaṣṭhas and others)? Or perhaps the influence was
in the other direction, and a technique known to practitioners elsewhere
in South Asia in the first millennium was integrated into the text of
Suśrutasaṃhitā. The rhinoplastic description consists of only five verses
and they are written in the Upendravajrā metre, which is different from
the rest of the chapter. The description’s appearance at the very end
of the chapter, its terseness, its ornate metre, and the paucity of the
commentators’ treatment could all be taken as pointing in this direction.

34 1.16.14 (Su 1938: 78): गण्डादुत्पाट्य मांसेन सानुबन्धेन जीवता | कर्णपालीमापालेस्तु कुर्यान्निर्लिख्य शास्त्रवित्। Cf. the translation of the whole passage by Wujastyk (2003: 94).

2 The Transmission of the Work
The Nepalese Version
In the present study and the other publications of our research group, we
focus on the study of what we call the ‘Nepalese version’ of the Suśrutasaṃhitā. The primary rationale behind using this designation was outlined by
Klebanov,1 but we consider it necessary to reflect upon its meaning here,
given the conceptual significance that this term occupies in our research. It
is possible that in the course of our research, we will refine our understanding of this designation and, consequently, review and modify our current
interpretation.
Put plainly, the ‘Nepalese version’ refers to a hypothetical text-critical
reconstruction of the wording of the Suśrutasaṃhitā that is based primarily
on the evidence of three ancient Nepalese manuscripts that we have briefly
introduced above and that we will describe in more detail in a later section.
We call these MSS “Nepalese” not just because they were preserved and
discovered by modern scholarship in the Kathmandu Valley but also because we believe that they were produced in the same area. We conclude
this because all three MSS are written in a specific variety of Indic script
which was not used outside of the region.
Furthermore, we speak of a single “version” because these manuscripts
attest to a specific line of transmission of the text. That is to say, in terms of
stemmatic analysis they share a common ancestor or hyparchetype, while
at the same time, they bear no signs of significant contamination. This
hypothesis was first postulated by Klebanov (2010) and later reiterated by
him (2021b) as the result of a systematic analysis of two complete chapters,
SS 1.3 and SS 1.15, and several shorter excerpts from the Suśrutasaṃhitā
transmitted in the Nepalese manuscripts. On the one hand, these studies
highlighted that all three MSS preserve a highly uniform text with very few
1

10
variations, virtually all of which can be explained as standard scribal errors
or corrections. On the other hand, Klebanov (2010; 2021b) systematically
compared the relevant textual excerpts with four printed editions, alternative readings reported by several commentators, parallel passages in other
texts, and with a number of additional manuscripts of the Suśrutasaṃhitā.
This analysis demonstrated that the text of the Suśrutasaṃhitā supported
by the Nepalese MSS of our study differs evidentially from all these other
sources. But the mere fact of Nepalese provenance does not guarantee that
a manuscript transmits the Nepalese version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā. For example, Klebanov also established that in spite of its Nepalese provenance,
MS Kathmandu NAK 1-1146,2 does not support the “Nepalese version”
and need not be taken into consideration when reconstructing the readings of the latter’s hyparchetype. Thus, we do not feel that it is justified to
use the technical term “Nepalese recension,” since at least two recensions
of the work are preserved in manuscripts from Nepal. Nevertheless, we
wish to indicate the provenance of the oldest witnesses. However, more
than two hundred manuscripts of the Suśrutasaṃhitā are preserved in different libraries across South Asia and until they have been studied and
place into a stemmatic relationship with our present witnesses, any hard
assumption about the regional character of the transmission line remains
premature.3 What can be said with certainty is that the Nepalese version
preserves many archaic features of an early version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā
and that some of these features have already been identified in other manuscripts of this work have be studied briefly.
Our research group builds upon the above hypothesis about the existence of a distinct Nepalese version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā and concentrates
primarily on the study of this text in its own right and, additionally, frequently compares it with the version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā promulgated by
the late medieval commentator Ḍalhaṇa and recorded in the widely-used
Su 1938. The present study of SS 1.16 also considers the readings found in
Su 1939, that reflects Cakrapāṇidatta’s readings, and incorporates various
observations made by both medieval commentators, Cakrapāṇidatta and
Ḍalhaṇa, into the notes of the edition and some annotations of the translation.

The current study and several earlier publications furnish a catalogue
of uniform features that are characteristic of the Nepalese version and set it
apart from the vulgate version.4 These features of the Nepalese version include orthographic variants, peculiarities in the structure and structuring
elements, as well as the actual wording of the text. As argued elsewhere
in this article, many of these variants appear to represent an archaic version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā. This is partly because they preserve a version of
the text that appears to be less edited, that is, more rudimentary in content
and original in expression, that in turn suggests that it precedes later editorial intervention. We also assign a high historical value to many Nepalese
readings because they constitute an internally more consistent and coherent text that is at times further supported by external testimonia.
Additionally, we want to make it clear that we do not think that the
Nepalese version provides a so-called original text of the Suśrutasaṃhitā.
Rather, the Nepalese version is a witness to a hyparchetype, not the archetype, of the Suśrutasaṃhitā. The Nepalese version provide us with an intermediary node in the history of this work between the oldest reconstructable text and the vulgate version that was known to Ḍalhaṇa in the twelfth
century and that is reproduced in most printed editions of the Suśrutasaṃhitā. The oldest reconstructable text will only come into focus when all
surviving witnesses for the work have been studied. Having said that, our
belief is that the Nepalese version is certain to be closer to the oldest reconstructable text than are contemporary printed versions of the work. One
of the reasons for this belief is simply that the Nepalese MSS give us physical evidence for the state of the work in the ninth century, which cannot
be many centuries later than the original assembly of the work in the form
we are familiar with, i.e., a work of five topical sections with a large added
sixth section, the Uttaratantra, that has a somewhat independent character.
To summarize: the evidence arising from our studies to this point leads
us to think that the Nepalese MSS of this study provide access to single
line of textual transmission that goes back to a hyparchetype that predates
the composition of all major commentaries on the Suśrutasaṃhitā and that,
due to its regional character, has suffered relatively little contamination.
We term this hyparchetype the “Nepalese version.”

The Versions of Cakrapāṇidatta and Ḍalhaṇa
The commentaries of Cakrapāṇidatta and Ḍalhaṇa, titled Bhānumatī and
Nibandhasaṅgraha respectively, are based on similar but not identical
versions of the Suśrutasaṃhitā. Both versions differ significantly from the
Nepalese version.5 Ḍalhaṇa was aware of Cakrapāṇidatta’s work and
reiterated many of his predecessor’s remarks, so the interpretation of the
root text by these two commentators is, broadly speaking, consistent.6
Ḍalhaṇa also had several manuscripts of the Suśrutasaṃhitā available to
him, as we know because he frequently mentioned their variant readings.7
In addition to the fine-grained issues raised by the relationship between
these commentators, there are added issues introduced by the way the editors of the printed versions of these commentaries handled the texts. The
most obvious difficulty is that Y. T. Ācārya and N. Śarman’s text of the
Sūtrasthāna as commented on by Cakrapāṇidatta (Su 1939) simply duplicated the main text of that section from Y. T. Ācārya and N. R. Ācārya’s edition of Ḍalhaṇa’s commentary (Su 1938).8 This duplication of the root text
in the two books creates the entirely misleading impression that both commentators had the same Suśrutasaṃhitā text before them.9 However, there
is much evidence, including in the chapter treated in the present study,
that this was not the case.
To give a concrete example, Ḍalhaṇa commented on four verses, SS

See HIML: IA 374–379 on these authors. Meulenbeld already noted that “the text
of the Suśrutasaṃhitā in the [1939] edition of the Bhānumatī differs at many places
from the text of the [vulgate edition of 1938]” and gave examples from the sūtrasthāna
(HIML: IB, 496, note 76).
HIML: IB, 499, n. 162.
See HIML: IA, 377. Meulenbeld drew attention to Ḍalhaṇa’s commentary on
5.8.24cd–25ab (Su 1938: 587) as a particularly striking example of such awareness
(HIML: IB, 497, n. 112). In this passage, Ḍalhaṇa noted that certain readings known
to the earlier commentators Jejjaṭa and Gayadāsa were, “not to be found in current
manuscripts” (स च वर्तमानपुस्तकेषु न दृश्यते).
There are a few exceptions where Cakrapāṇidatta glossed a word or compound that
is different to the one glossed by Ḍalhaṇa. For example, in SS 1.16.18, Cakrapāṇidatta
glossed राजसर्षप whereas Ḍalhaṇa glossed गौरसर्षप. The editors reflected this in the root
texts of the Bhānumatī (Su 1939: 130) and Nibandhasaṅgraha (Su 1938: 79) respectively.
A similar situation exists with the edition of the Yogasūtravivaraṇa by Rama Sastri and
Krishnamurthi Sastri (1952) that is printed with the base text of the Pātañjalayogaśāstra
taken the edition of Āgāśe and Āpaṭe (1904) which is significantly different from that
on which Śaṅkara was commenting (Maas 2013: 77–78).

13
1.16.11–14, as part of his root text, that Cakrapāṇidatta cited separately
only in his commentary.10 Cakrapāṇidatta had introduced each verse with
“some people say” (केचित्पठन्ति). This clearly indicated that these verses
were not in the version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā upon which he was commenting. But a century or so later they had become part of the main text that
was read by Ḍalhaṇa. In spite of this, the editors Y. T. Ācārya and N. Śarman included these verses in their 1939 edition of the Suśrutasaṃhitā with
Cakrapāṇidatta’s commentary as if they had been part of the main text of
the Suśrutasaṃhitā that Cakrapāṇidatta read. Such cases make it hard for
the reader to clearly see that these two important commentators were responding to different versions of the Suśrutasaṃhitā.
Furthermore, the duplication of the root text is questionable in
instances where Cakrapāṇidatta did not acknowledge or comment on
some verses that appear in what we might call “Ḍalhaṇa’s version” of the
Suśrutasaṃhitā. In some cases, this is an argumentum ex silentio because it
is possible that Cakrapāṇidatta may not have remarked on a verse when
its meaning was obvious. However, in other cases, the commentarial convention of citing the first words of a new verse or passage suggests leads
us to suspect the absence of a verse in the root text of the Suśrutasaṃhitā.
For example, there is a prose passage at SS 1.16.18 that Cakrapāṇidatta
commented on in his Bhānumatī (Fig. 2.1, left).11 It is followed by several
verses also in the main text of the Suśrutasaṃhitā that elaborate on the content of the prose passage.12 Ḍalhaṇa commented on these explanatory
verses (Fig. 2.1, right), citing keywords that show they all formed part of
the main text of the Suśrutasaṃhitā that was before him.13 However, Cakrapāṇidatta’s older commentary showed no awareness of the first few verses
in this group, SS 1.16.19–21ab.14 Apparently, they were not part of the text
of the Suśrutasaṃhitā as he knew it. In spite of that, the editors printed these
verses in their edition of Cakrapāṇidatta’s work as if they were indeed part
of the Suśrutasaṃhitā known to him. Incidentally, the editors remarked in a
footnote that verses 20–21a were not in the Nepalese manuscript that they
10 Su 1938: 78 and Su 1939: 128–129 respectively.
11 Su 1939: 130, i.e., अथाप्रदुष्तस्याभिवर्धनार्थम्… निदध्यात्।. It is numbered Su.1.16.19 in Dalhaṇa’s Nibandhasaṅgraha (Su 1938: 79).

consulted. This shows that the version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā that Cakrapāṇidatta knew is similar to the Nepalese version, at least in this particular
case.15
A similar instance occurs in the edition of the Bhānumatī at SS 1.16.31,
where the editors of the 1939 printed edition included a verse in parenthesis that was commented on by Ḍalhaṇa but not by Cakrapāṇidatta (see
Fig. 2.2).16 This verse was almost certainly not in the text of the Suśrutasaṃhitā known to Cakrapāṇidatta. The manuscript on which the editors’
edition of Cakrapāṇidatta’s Bhānumatī commentary was mainly based, MS
London BL H. T. Colebrooke 908, does not include the root text of the Su15 Su 1939: 130, n. 2.
16 The verse begins नाडीयोगं विनौष्थस्य. It is printed in the vulgate as 1.16.32 (Su 1938: 81),
with Ḍalhaṇa’s commentary. It is printed in parentheses as 1.16.31 in the edition of
the Bhānumatī (Su 1939: 133).

15
śrutasaṃhitā.17 Therefore, it requires a careful reading of the commentary
itself to reverse-engineer, as it were, what its author, Cakrapāṇidatta, was
seeing in the manuscripts of the Suśrutasaṃhitā that he had before him in
the eleventh century. But there is no evidence that they included the verses
SS 1.16.19–-21ab and 31 that are printed in the Su 1939 edition as if they were
present to Cakrapāṇidatta.

Cakrapāṇidatta and the Nepalese version
We have already seen one case where Cakrapāṇidatta’s version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā was more similar to the older Nepalese version than to the later
version of Ḍalhaṇa. There is more evidence for this. For example, SS 1.16.5
of the Nepalese version begins with the compound दोषसमुदयात्; Cakrapāṇidatta began his comment on this passage by glossing this very expression.
By contrast, Ḍalhaṇa’s version inserted two compounds, क्लिष्टजिह्माप्रशस्तसूचीव्यधात्and गाढतरवर्तित्वात्, before this.18 It appears that Cakrapāṇidatta was
not aware of the compounds that Ḍalhaṇa saw in his later version, but was
indeed reading a text similar to the Nepalese version.19
If one looks beyond SS 1.16, there are further instances where the
Nepalese version and the root text as read by Cakrapāṇidatta have the
same reading, but Ḍalhaṇa mentioned it as an alternative that is, “read
by others.” For example, the Nepalese version of SS 1.1.22 begins तत्रास्मिञ्छास्त्रे…, which is also the reading commented on by Cakrapāṇidatta.20
However, Ḍalhaṇa commented on अस्मिञ्छास्त्रे and stated that “others read
तत्रास्मिञ्छास्त्रे”.21
Another example is the reading of षष्ट्या विधानैः in Ḍalhaṇa’s commentary
on SS 1.1.8.1 that is not in his main text but that he ascribes to “some others”.22 This reading is likely to be derived from the expression षष्ट्याभिधानैः
17 This observation is based on an examination of the opening passage MS London BL
H. T. Colebrooke 908. The MS is described in IOLR: v. 1.5, 928, #2647. The section
“The 1939 Edition,” on p. 31 below, describes the sources that the editors used for that
edition.

in the main text of the Nepalese version, and to have been rewritten before
Ḍalhaṇa’s time because it was hard to understand.23

Differences between the Nepalese and later versions of SS 1.16
Several differences between the text of the Suśrutasaṃhitā as reconstructed
on the basis of the Nepalese MSS and as found in its multiple contemporary
printed editions have already been pointed out in previous publications.
For example, Klebanov listed differences in the chapter sequences as they
affect the overall organization and structuring of themes and elements of
the text.24 Others have explored variations in the frame story of the work
as a whole.25 Klebanov discussed the interchangeable use of two titles for
the first book of the text, namely “Ślokasthāna” and “Sūtrasthāna.” He also
discussed another feature of the Nepalese version, namely the additional
colophons found at the end of each book and also at the end of each decade
of chapters of the work.26

The greater internal coherence of the Nepalese version
In an exemplary investigation of textual variants in the Nepalese version,
Harimoto studied the classification of snakes in SS 5.4 and revealed that
the Nepalese version preserves a text that is internally more consistent and
coherent than the versions of the Suśrutasaṃhitā found in different printed
sources.27
Klebanov contributed some further general remarks and examples of
substantive differences between the Nepalese and vulgate versions, and
provided two more case studies.28 The first dealt with the list of skin lesions associated with urinary disease.29 Their signs and pathogenesis are

described in the Nidānasthāna and their treatment in the Cikitsāsthāna.30
This list of skin lesions exemplifies a case where the Nepalese version of
the Suśrutasaṃhitā is internally more coherent than that commented on by
Ḍalhaṇa. The incoherence of Ḍalhaṇa’s version was already identified by
an earlier commentator, Gayadāsa (fl. ca. 1000), who proposed a textual
conjecture that corresponds to the reading of the Nepalese version.31
The second case study by Klebanov focussed on the variation in the list
of bodily winds (प्राण) in SS 3.4.32 This discussion too relied upon Gayadāsa’s learned remarks. He commented on a version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā
corresponding to the Nepalese version and reported an alternative reading and its interpretation preferred by another ancient commentator, Jejjaṭa
(fl. ca. 650 – c. 750). It is Jejjaṭa’s reading that is known to modern readers
of the Suśrutasaṃhitā from the vulgate version of the text.
As the present study demonstrates, many features pertaining to the actual content of the Nepalese version continue to come to light as we proceed
with our study of the manuscripts. On the whole, these observations indicate that many features of the Nepalese version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā are
likely to go back to an early state of the work that was common to other versions of the compendium. However, there are also textual features, such
as the text-structuring colophons concluding every tenth chapter, are likely
to have occurred within a local Nepalese transmission of the text and it is
unlikely that they will be attested in MSS from other regions, when a study
of those is done. When evaluating the Nepalese readings historically, it is
necessary to keep in mind that there is plentiful evidence that Ḍalhaṇa’s
version of the text also included extremely early readings and variants, suggesting that some of the readings accepted by Ḍalhaṇa were ancient, if not
original. Each case has to be weighed, and we are not yet in a position to
make definitive jugements about the early divergence of textual recensions.
The detailed comparison that follows of 1.16 of the Nepalese version
with Ḍalhaṇa’s Nibandhasaṅgraha unfolded as the chapter was edited.
The differences appear to emanate largely from attempts in Ḍalhaṇa’s
version to standardise, simplify or clarify the language that appears
30 Suśrutasaṃhitā 2.6 (Su 1938: 289–294) and 4.12 (Su 1938: 454–455) respectively.
31 MS Kathmandu KL 699 was copied a century or more before Gayadāsa’s time, so its
version cannot have been influenced by Gayadāsa’s innovations or suggestions. The
reverse is more likely, although we are still uncertain of whether Gayadāsa was aware
of the Nepalese version. Being from Bengal, it is not unlikely that he knew it.

in the Nepalese version, to add and redact information, and introduce
changes to recipes and therapies. Examples from 1.16 have been provided
to demonstrate these general observations which, we expect, will be
supported by a larger survey of the text.

Transpositions
Figure 2.3 reveals the extent to which 1.16 of the Nepalese version was
redacted to create the one known by Ḍalhaṇa. In this particular case,
twenty-seven verses have been added in the vulgate. Eight of these
verses (11–14, 21–22ab, 23cd–24, 32) are well integrated with the existing
material in so far as they reiterate and elaborate on the content of passages
in the Nepalese version. A block of nineteen verses (26.1–19) at the end of
this chapter in Ācārya’s edition of the Nibandhasaṅgraha (Su 1938: 80) was
known by Ḍalhaṇa. These verses cover additional diseases of the ear lobes,
with their treatment and complications. Although Ḍalhaṇa conceded
that some predecessors read them in this chapter, he concludes that they
were not composed by sages and, therefore, should not be read. Ācārya
probably included these verses because they were in his manuscripts, but
Ḍalhaṇa’s comments prompted him to place them in parentheses.33 Be
this as it may, this large block of verses is not present in the Nepalese
version.
One can also see in Figure 2.3 that verses 17 and 18 of the Nepalese
version were transposed in the redaction of Ḍalhaṇa’s version, where they
are numbered 26 and 25 respectively. Although this only occurs once in
1.16, such transposing of verses and even their hemistiches is common in
the redaction of other chapters of the Suśrutasaṃhitā.
Apart from the addition of verses, the redacting of the version known
to Ḍalhaṇa involved many small, yet sometimes significant, changes that
are described below.34
33 Ācārya (Su 1938: 80) did not state that these verses were absent in some or all of his
manuscripts, which he usually did in a footnote if this was the case. A broader survey
of manuscripts would be helpful for establishing whether these verses were part of
the transmission of the Suśrutasaṃhitā in other parts of India. For example, they are
present in MS Hyderabad Osmania 137-3(b).
34 The present study focusses on the commentary of Ḍalhaṇa, but many of the same
investigations could be made with regard to the surviving parts of the other early
commentaries. See the discussion below, p. 33.

Changing Spelling, Sandhi and Syntax
Later commentators like Ḍalhaṇa often made efforts to standardise, simplify or improve the language of the Nepalese version. Such changes include the standardising of spelling,35 sandhi,36 and verbal forms,37 as well
as interventions to simplify and clarify syntax.38 These efforts often in35 For example, पत्ताङ्ग (SS 1.16.21) → पतङ्ग (1.16.29, Su 1938: 81). For more information on
this, see footnote 36 to the translation.
36 For example, ॰हस्तेन ऋजु (SS 1.16.2) → ॰हस्तेन र्जु (1.16.3, Su 1938: 76).
37 For example, उन्नामयित्वा (SS 1.16.21) → प्रान्नम्य (1.16.29, Su 1938: 81); अवचूर्णयीत (SS
1.16.21) → उपहरेत्(1.16.29, Su 1938: 81).
38 For example, शोणितबहुत्वनिवेदनायां चान्यदेशविद्धमिति जानीयात् | निरुपद्रवता तद्देशविद्धलिङ्गम्। (SS
1.16.3) → शोणितबहुत्वेन वेदनया चान्यदेशविद्धमिति जानीयात्। निरुपद्रवतया तद्देशविद्धम्इति। (1.16.4,
Su 1938: 76); आमतैलपरिषेकेणोपचरेत्(SS 1.16.6) → आमतैलेन परिषेचयेत्(1.16.7, Su 1938: 77);
सुपरिगृहीतं (SS 1.16.10) → सुपरिगृहीतं च कृत्वा (1.16.15, Su 1938: 78); अनेन (SS 1.16.15) → स्नेहेनैतेन (1.16.20, Su 1938: 79).

20
volved splitting compounds.39 In some instances, these changes improved
the grammar,40 or altered the meaning.41 However, some prefixes of verbal
forms,42 case endings,43 and indeclinables were changed for less apparent
reasons.44 There is also a tendency to replace uncommon words with generic ones,45 add indeclinables,46 omit the verb “to be” at the end of sentences,47 and introduce verses after a prose passage with the phrase भवति
चात्र.48

Technical Terms
There is evidence of standardising and altering technical terminology in
versions of the Suśrutasaṃhitā subsequent the Nepalese one. Two examples
of this in Suśrutasaṃhitā 1.16 are the terms for “joins” (बन्ध) and “a slice of
flesh” (वध्र). The Nepalese version uses three terms for “joining” splits in
the ear flaps and the flesh of nose (बन्ध, सन्धान, सन्धि). Redactors of subsequent versions appear to have tried to standardise this terminology by
replacing सन्धान and सन्धि with बन्ध in prose passages.49 However, the use of
the term सन्धान was retained in verses, perhaps because of the metrical challenges of making such a change or perhaps because the verses had greater
39 For example, यदृच्छाविद्धायां सिरायाम्(SS 1.16.4) → यदृच्छया विद्धासुसिरासु(1.16.5, Su 1938: 76);
धान्याम्लकपालचूर्णं (SS 1.16.10) → धान्याम्लं कपालचूर्णं (1.16.20, Su 1938: 78).
40 For example, सुरामण्डक्षीरम्(SS 1.16.10) → सुरामण्डं क्षीरम्(1.16.15, Su 1938: 78).
41 For example, क्षीणाल्पमांसः (SS 1.16.12) → क्षीणोऽल्पमांसः (1.16.17, Su 1938: 79).
42 For example, सम्वर्द्धितः (SS 1.16.8) → विवर्द्धितः (1.16.9, Su 1938: 77); निवेश्य (SS 1.16.10) →
सन्निवेश्य (1.16.15, Su 1938: 78); अवबध्य (SS 1.16.10) → च बद्ध्वा (1.16.15, Su 1938: 78).
43 For example, मासे (SS 1.16.2) → मासि (1.16.3, Su 1938: 76).
44 For example, अपि (SS 1.16.13) → वा (1.16.18, Su 1938: 79); च (SS 1.16.16) → तु (1.16.23,
Su 1938: 79); तु (SS 1.16.18) → च (1.16.25, Su 1938: 80).
45 For example, म्रक्षयेत्(SS 1.16.15) → योजयेत्(1.16.20, Su 1938: 79); नह्येत्(SS 1.16.21) → बद्ध्वा
(1.16.29, Su 1938: 81).
46 For example, [absent] (SS 1.16.6) → च (1.16.7, Su 1938: 77); [absent] (SS 1.16.10) → तत्र
(1.16.15, Su 1938: 78); [absent] (SS 1.16.12) → अपि (1.16.17, Su 1938: 79).
47 The words भवति or भवन्ति are omitted four times in Ḍalhaṇa’s version (1.16.10 (twice),
1.16.17 and 1.16.18 (Su 1938: 77, 79)).
48 For example, [absent] (SS 1.16.11) → भवति चात्र (1.16.16, Su 1938: 79).
49 For example, पञ्चदशसन्धानाकृतयः (SS 1.16.9) → पञ्चदशबन्धाकृतयः (see 1.16.10 (Su 1938: 77));
दशकर्णसन्धिविकल्पाः (SS 1.16.9) → कर्णबन्धविकल्पाः (see 1.16.10 (Su 1938: 77))

traditional authority. Also, the names of joins which incorporate सन्धान and
सन्धि remained the same.50
The Nepalese version contains the rather obscure term वध्र for the slice
of flesh that a surgeon cuts from the cheek in order to construct a new
nose.51 Modern dictionaries define वध्र as a leathern strap or a slice of bacon,52 the latter of which is more indicative of its meaning in the Nepalese
version. This word was written out of subsequent versions,53 and it was not
mentioned as an alternative reading by either Cakrapāṇidatta or Ḍalhaṇa,
which suggests that its use and meaning may not have been known to them.
However, वध्र was used by the author of the Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā in the
context of rhinoplasty, so it likely to be the correct reading in the Nepalese
version.54

Augmenting the Text
Apart from adding whole passages and verses (as seen in Figure 2.3), redactors of subsequent versions augmented the text by expanding existing
compounds and inserting new compounds and words. Within the microcosm of 1.16, adjectives and adverbs were inserted to clarify statements,55
and phrases added to elaborate on diseases and treatments.56 In particular, the characteristics and number of symptoms of a disease, as well
as their reasons for arising, tend to increase in subsequent versions. For
example, the Nepalese version (SS 1.16.5) said that the wick in a newly

53 वध्रम्(SS 1.16.20) → बद्धम्(SS 1.16.28, Su 1938: 81) and तद्वध्रशेषं (SS 1.16.23) → तदर्धशेषं (SS
1.16.31, Su 1938: 81).
54 Utt.18.62 (Ah 1939: 841). This may suggest some indepencence between the text of
the Suśrutasaṃhitā as transmitted to its direct commentators and as transmitted to
Vāgbhaṭa. The word वध्र is old, occurring, also in the form वर्ध्र, from the Atharvaveda
onwards (Mayrhofer 1986–2001: v. 2, 521–522).
55 For example, छिद्रे (1.16.2, Su 1938: 76) → छिद्र आदित्यकरावभासिते (1.16.3, Su 1938: 76); [absent] (1.16.2) → शनैः शनैः (1.16.3); [absent] (SS 1.16.3) → आशु (1.16.5, Su 1938: 77).
56 For example, धात्र्यङ्के (SS 1.16.2) → धात्र्यङ्के कुमारधराङ्के वा (1.16.3); [absent] (SS 1.16.2) →

pierced ear should be removed because of aggravated humours or a culpable piercing whereas the version known to Ḍalhaṇa (1.16.6 (Su 1938: 77))
included two further reasons, namely, because of piercing with a painful,
crooked and unrecommended needle or because of a wick that is too thick.
Some of the split ear flaps in Ḍalhaṇa’s version have additional characteristics,57 and a list of four symptoms associated with incurable joins in
the Nepalese version (SS 1.16.19) was increased to six in Ḍalhaṇa’s version (1.16.10 (Su 1938: 77)). Also, models of classifying symptoms were
introduced in subsequent versions. For example, the Nepalese version
(SS 1.16.4) lists the symptoms of mistakenly piercing a duct in the ear
whereas the version known to Ḍalhaṇa (1.16.5, Su 1938: 76–77) classifies
these symptoms according to three ducts called कालिका, मर्मरिका and लोहितिका, which results in some repetition of the symptoms mentioned.58

Transposing Words, Verses and Passages
A close comparison of the Nepalese version with the vulgate reveals
changes in the order of words, sentences and verses. Examples of such
transpositions occur in SS 1.16. In most cases, the changes in word order
are insignificant and may be result of different preferences in syntax or
even scribal eye-brain-hand miscommunication.59 However, the transposition of verses and passages is usually the result of efforts at redacting
the text to add new material. A good example of this is the transposition
of SS 1.16.17 and SS 1.16.18 in the Nepalese version to 1.16.26 and 1.16.25,
57 For example, पीठोपमपालिर्निर्वेधिमः (1.16.9, Su 1938: 77) → पीठोपमपालिरुभयतः क्षीणपुत्रिकाश्रितो
निर्वेधिमः (1.16.10, Su 1938: 77); इतराल्पपालिः संक्षिप्तः (SS 1.16.9) → उत्सन्नपालिरितराल्पपालिः संक्षिप्तः (1.16.10); तनुविषमपालिः (SS 1.16.9) → तनुविषमाल्पपालिः (1.16.10).
58 In Ḍalhaṇa’s version (1.16.5, Su 1938: 76–77), the symptoms of fever and pain (ज्वर, वेदना) are repeated. This repetition does not occur in the Nepalese version. It is possible
that this classification was not in the version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā known to Cakrapāṇidatta (1.16.4, Su 1939: 126) because he mentions that some read classifications of
ducts at this point in the text and he cites verses from Bhoja on कालिका, मर्मरिका and
लोहितिका, but he does not gloss or comment on the passage known to Ḍalhaṇa.
59 For example, अणुस्थूल॰ (SS 1.16.9) → स्थूलाणु॰ (1.16.10, Su 1938: 77); तत्रैते दशकर्ण॰ (SS
1.16.9) → तत्र दशैते कर्ण॰ (1.16.10, Su 1938: 77); नातिगाढन्नातिशिथिलं सूत्रेणावबध्य (SS 1.16.9)
→ सूत्रेणानवगाढमनतिशिथिलं च बद्ध्वा (1.16.10, Su 1938: 77); पूर्वन्दक्षिणं कुमारस्य वामङ्कन्यायाः | प्रतनुं
सूच्या बहलमारया  (SS 1.16.2) → प्रतनुकं सूच्या बहलमारया। पूर्वं दक्षिणं कुमारस्य वामङ्कन्यायाः (1.16.3,
Su 1938: 76).

23
respectively, in Ḍalhaṇa’s. It seems that this transposition may have
resulted from the insertion of new verses 1.16.23cd–24 and 1.16.26.1–19 in
the latter.

Redacting Recipes and Elaborating on Treatments
Some of the additional text in subsequent versions of the Suśrutasaṃhitā
introduces new ingredients in recipes and different procedures in treatments. In many instances, the new material merely clarifies or elaborates
on the original but sometimes it changes the recipe or treatment significantly. An example of a suppletion that clarifies the text of the Nepalese
version can be seen in 1.16.3 of Ḍalhaṇa’s version (Su 1938: 76), which contains a statement that the physician should insert a wick of cotton after the
ear has been pierced.60 This statement anticipates the instructions in the
the Nepalese version (SS 1.16.5–6) on removing the wick because of aggravated humours and replacing the wick with a thicker one every three
days. In this case, the additional statement of Ḍalhaṇa’s version elucidates
the role of the wick in the procedure of piercing the ear.
A similar clarification occurs in Ḍalhaṇa’s version at 1.16.18
(Su 1938: 70),61 which reiterates the cure for an ear tainted by a humour that was described earlier in 1.16.7.62 The reiteration is quite apt
because it follows a passage that outlines the various symptoms of ear
disease arising from each of the three humours.63 The author of the
Nepalese version probably assumed that, after reading SS 1.16.12, the
reader would refer back to SS 1.16.6 for the cure of an ear affected by a
humour. However, in Ḍalhaṇa’s version, the treatment is reiterated.
In Ḍalhaṇa’s version of 1.16, there are two instances in which ingredients were added to recipes of medicines in the Nepalese version. The first
is the recipe of an ointment that should be applied to a pierced ear that
has not healed. In Ḍalhaṇa’s version, the recipe was rewritten to include
sesame seeds.64 A more significant change occurs in another recipe for
an admixture of an oil that is supposed to be rubbed into a healthy ear to

24
enlarge it. Ḍalhaṇa’s version of the admixture has five additional ingredients, namely, prickly chaff-flower, Withania, milk-white, sweet plants and
Indian ipecac.65 It also has beggarweed instead of Indian kudzu.66
The general tendency in redacting a recipe from the Nepalese version
was to preserve most ingredients of the original and to add new ones.

Comparative therapeutics
For at least two reasons, it is interesting to compare the text materials of
the Suśrutasaṃhitā 1.16 with parallel materials found in other texts, including the Carakasaṃhitā, Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha, and Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā. The latter two works, both ascribed to Vāgbhaṭa, can safely be dated to a period
after the composition of the Suśrutasaṃhitā but before the commentator
Ḍalhaṇa, thus throwing light on a period of development for which witnesses are limited and also also broadly the period at which the Nepalese
version was current. Secondly, the manner in which Vāgbhaṭa’s works incorporate and modify materials from the Suśrutasaṃhitā can help us to understand how recipes and therapies evolved within specific lines of textual
transmission.
The materials presented in Suśrutasaṃhitā 1.16 are parallel to those in
two chapters of the Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha, namely Uttarasthāna, chapters 1 and
22, titled “bālopacaraṇīya” and “karṇarogapratiṣedha,” and Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā, Uttarasthāna 1 and 18 with the same chapter names.67
First, let us return to the comments on the insertion of a wick that
were mentioned above (p.23). The Nepalese version says nothing, while
Ḍalhaṇa’s version says “one should insert a cloth wick” (पिचुवर्तिं प्रवेशयेत्).
A little later, both versions say, “one should remove the wick”.68 It seems
likely that the editor of Ḍalhaṇa’s version added the initial phrase about

25
inserting the wick because it seemed necessary to say that the wick was
applied before being removed. The older Nepalese version seems slightly
less coherent on this point, but is perhaps represents an earlier recension
on the principle of lectio dificilior potior. Both the Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha and
the Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā describe first inserting a thread in the pierced
earlobe and subsequently replacing it every third day.69 In this repect,
they agree with Ḍalhaṇa’s version.
Secondly, it is interesting to consider again the recipe prescribed to treat
the vitiation of humours in the pierced ear, mentioned above. A slightly
modified recipe is found in the Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha 6.1.63 (As 1980: 626), but
the same is not present in Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā. As pointed out above,
Ḍalhaṇa’s version adds a paste of sesame seeds (तिलकल्क) to the recipe attested by the Nepalese version. In the parallel version of recipe found in
the printed editions of Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha, honey (मधु) is missing, but ghee
(आज्य) is found. However, when checking the manuscripts of the Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha, one of them reads आद्यैः instead of आज्यैः(यवैरण्डजटायष्टीमञ्जिष्ठाज्यैः प्रलेपयेत्).70 Interestingly, the paste of sesame seeds (तिलकल्क) of Ḍalhaṇa’s
version is not present in the Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha and is replaced by जटा, which
is most probably spikenard.
Since the paste of sesame seeds is the main differentiating factor
between the recipe versions attested by the Nepalese version and
Ḍalhaṇa’s version, a general review of the contexts of its use in the major
texts may be enlightening. References for the paste of sesame seeds are
found in the texts shown in Table 2.1. Among them, references with the

and two instances in Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā. A combination of the paste
of sesame seeds, ghee and honey has also been specifically quoted as a
general healing recipe.71
Another matter of interest is the combination of ghee and honey. We
find many instances where this unique combination alone or in combination with other drugs is used in a variety of clinical contexts including
those prescribed for the healing of ulcers or surgical wounds.72
This material evidence points to the general trend that medicines in the
older Nepalese version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā present a central core recipe,
consisting of a few drugs, that develops with ever-increasing complexity
in the more recent version of Ḍalhaṇa and later authors.

71 E.g., Suśrutasaṃhitā 1.11.22ab (Su 1938: 49), Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha 1.38.21 (As 1980: 249–
250) and Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā 1.30.34 (Ah 1939: 357).
72 E.g., Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha 1.37.30 (As 1980: 246) for क्षतकण्ठ and Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha 4.17.22
(As 1980: 517) for healing of the surgical wound in उदररोग.

3 The Printed Editions
The careful survey of printed editions of the Suśrutasaṃhitā by Meulenbeld lists no fewer than 44 entries.1 These range from the first edition
by Madhusūdana Gupta (1835) to editions in the 1970s. The number of
reprints and editions since that time might almost double that number.
Translations began with Hessler’s Latin translation in 1844 and continue
up to the present in scores of publications in many languages.2

The vulgate
The great ayurvedic scholar Yādavaśarman Trivikrama Ācārya produced
three successive editions of the Suśrutasaṃhitā with the commentary of
Ḍalhaṇa, in 1915, 1931 and 1938. These editions, especially the last, are
generally considered the most scholarly and reliable editions of the work,
and have been constantly reprinted up to the present day.3 We refer to the
last of these editions as “the vulgate.”
The 1915 edition was based on three manuscripts. The 1931 edition used
another seven manuscripts plus two printed editions. For his final 1938
edition, Ācārya used a further three manuscripts.4 These sources were described by Ācārya as follows; we provide an overview in Table 3.1.

Evaluation
Estimates show that there are approximately 230 extant manuscript witnesses for the Suśrutasaṃhitā.10 Although most of these manuscripts cover
only parts of the whole work, they amount to approximately twenty times
the evidence that was used by Ācārya for his vulgate editions.

While the descriptions provided by Ācārya of his source materials
seems at first to be moderately comprehensive, Table 3.1 reveals the
underlying paucity of textual sources for these editions. At first, it appears
that fifteen manuscripts were consulted. However, we quickly see that
two of the sources were other people’s printed editions, and one of those
covered less than a quarter of the work (no. 9 of 1931). That reduces the
manuscript base to 13 witnesses. Ācārya does not appear to have seen two
of the manuscripts at all, having been sent collations prepared for him by
others (7 of 1931 and 3 of 1938). Thus, Ācārya’s final edition was based
on the personal consultation of eleven partial manuscripts. One of them
remains unidentified (6 of 1931). Only a single manuscript covers the
whole of the Suśrutasaṃhitā, no. 5 of the 1931 edition. Manuscript 1 of 1938
is the next most complete, but it omits the uttaratantra, which comprises
a third of the work. Manuscript 1 of the 1915 edition is third in size, but
it still omits both of the longest chapters, and thus offers less than half
the work. For the rest, the evidence is spotty, with each part of the work
being supported by only between four and eight manuscripts, excluding
the printed editions.
Two sources stand out for their historical importance. The first is no. 3 of
1931, which Ācārya calls “extremely old.” It covered the śārīrasthāna only,
and unfortunately we know nothing of the later history of this manuscript.
The second is no. 3 of 1938, which is one of the important Nepalese manuscripts being considered in the present project. Ācārya’s remarks and references to Hemarājaśarman’s introduction to the Kāśyapasaṃhitā allow us
to identify this manuscript as MS Kathmandu NAK 5-333.11 The editors
of the vulgate, Y. T. Ācārya and N. R. Ācārya, stated that this manuscript
covered up to the ninth chapter of the cikitsāsthāna, but in fact it covers the
whole work.12 Perhaps the editors only received collations for this portion
of the manuscript and did not know that it was a witness for the whole
work.

The 1939 edition
In 1939, Yādavaśarman Trivikrama Ācārya and Nandakiśora Śarman coedited an edition of the sūtrasthāna of the Suśrutasaṃhitā that was published
by the Swami Laxmi Ram ayurvedic centre in Jaipur, and printed at the
famous Nirṇayasāgara Press in Mumbai (see Fig. 3.1).13 The text was edited on the basis of the following sources.

For the Bhānumatī
1. A printed edition. Covered the Bhānumatī up to chapter Su.sū.40.
The siglum was मु for मुद्रित.14
2. A manuscript in the India Office Library library provided through
the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune.15 This manuscript covered the Bhānumatī up to the end of the sūtrasthāna. The
siglum was ह for हस्तलिखित.16

For the Suśrutasaṃhitā
1. A palm leaf manuscript from Hemarājaśarman’s personal library.17
The siglum was ता for ताडपत्र.
2. His own published edition. The siglum was ड for डल्हणसंमतः पाठः.18

the library of the Calcutta Sanskrit College, and described in H. Sastri and Gui 1895–

Evaluation
The main innovation of this publication was to present the only surviving part of the commentary on the Suśrutasaṃhitā by the great eleventhcentury medical scholar Cakrapāṇidatta, namely the Bhānumatī.20 A secondary purpose was to present the text of the sūtrasthāna as read in MS
Kathmandu NAK 5-333, that had recently been brought to the editors’ attention. In their judgement, the Kathmandu manuscript presented a text
that was closer to what Cakrapāṇidatta had before him than the text according to Ḍalhaṇa. In spite of this, the editors largely reproduced the root
text of Ḍalhaṇa’s version. This was the first Suśrutasaṃhitā edition in which
Ācārya used sigla to identify the sources from which variant readings were
reported, so while it has limitations, it for the first time enables us to get
some idea of origins of his readings at the level of individual words and
sentences (see Figure 3.1).
Ācārya noted in his introduction that the manuscripts containing
Ḍalhaṇa’s commentary all came together with the root-text of the Suśrutasaṃhitā, and thus the main Suśrutasaṃhitā text reflected the readings
chosen by Ḍalhaṇa. But the manuscripts of the Bhānumatī contained the
commentary alone, without the root-text, and had many explanations
based on different readings of the root-text than those of Ḍalhaṇa. In
many of these cases it was hard to infer what readings Cakrapāṇidatta
had before him. But Ācārya noted that Cakrapāṇidatta had a text before
him that had much in common with the text of the Nepalese manuscript.21
There is compelling evidence that Cakrapāṇidattas’s Bhānumatī commentary once covered the whole text of the Suśrutasaṃhitā.22 The loss of
the rest of the work ranks amongst the greatest disasters in Āyurvedic literature. Remarkably, the whole Bhānumatī may still have existed in the
early twentieth century. In 1903, Palmyr Cordier reported being privately

4 The Manuscripts
Our edition is based on the textual evidence of three manuscripts. All three
were produced in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal and preserved in libraries there. Klebanov (2021a: §2.1) provided a comprehensive description
of the individual manuscripts, quotes and translates their colophons and
thoroughly examines various problems involved in their interpretation.1
That is why we will present only the key data essential for the study of our
edition in the present book. In referring to the manuscripts, we use the
sigla K, N and H, which correspond to the initial letters in the names of the
libraries and collection where the respective bundles were discovered.
MS Kathmandu KL 699, siglum K This manuscript has been preserved
at the Kaiser Shamsher (KL) library in Kathmandu, accession number KL 699.2 See Fig. 4.1. It was microfilmed and catalogued by the
NGMPP/ NGMCP as C 80-7.3 The MS comprises 152 palm-leaf folios that originally belonged to several different codicological units
written by different scribes.4 The folios are 53.5 × 4.4 cm in size and
have two string holes. The text is written in the so-called transitional
Gupta script, with six to eight lines per folio.5 The MS is incomplete and contains a large part of the Suśrutasaṃhitā as well as the
Sauśrutanighaṇṭu.6 The date stated in the colophon at the end of the
compendium is verified for Sunday, April 13, 878 ce. However, physical damage to the manuscript folio containing the colophon means

Bhattarai (2020: 46) and Klebanov (2021a: 11) agree that four to five scribes were involved in the manuscript’s production.
Codicological features of the manuscript, such as the layout, peculiarities of the script,
various ornamental and text-dividing symbols and many more, were scrutinized in
Bhattarai (2020).
Klebanov (2021a: 11) provided a detailed description of the content.

that it is no longer possible to interpret it definitively. In particular, two persons are mentioned in the concluding remarks, someone
called Śrī Harṣacandra and Vaidya Vasuvarman, but their roles are
not perfectly clear. Klebanov (2021a: 16) thinks that the former,
…either sponsored the copying enterprise or wrote the
manuscript himself, [and that he subsequently] donated it
to Vaidya Vasuvarman on the condition that he (Vasuvarman) would study the text and explain it to others. The
second condition was that the manuscript should remain
in the family and not be given away either for sale or as a
pawn. If the manuscript sat unused, it should be returned
to Śrī Harṣacandra.7

and A 1267-11(2).9 The MS comprises 65 palm-leaf folios, 56 × 5 cm
in size, with two string holes each, and it is bundled together in a
composite manuscript with at least one other medical work. The text
is written in a variety of Newari script, with seven lines per folio on
average. Although the text contained in the MS does not cover the
entire Suśrutasaṃhitā and breaks off abruptly in the second chapter
of the śārīrasthāna, the actual MS, as a codicological unit, appears
complete, that is, no leaf seems to be missing from the originally
unitary artefact. Based on paleographic considerations, the MS can
be dated tentatively to the twelfth or thirteenth century.
MS Kathmandu NAK 5-333, siglum H This MS belonged to the historical
collection of Hemarāja Śarman (fl. 1878–1953) and is currently kept
at the NAK under accession number NAK 5-333.10 See Fig. 4.3. It has
been microfilmed twice by the NGMPP as B 29-19 and B 30-15, but
the latter microfilm is incomplete.11 The manuscript comprises 435
palm-leaf folios, 34×5 cm in size, with one string-hole left of centre. It
is written in a type of Newari script that is more recent than that of N,
with approximately six lines per folio. The MS is exceptionally well
preserved. Most importantly for the present project, the MS supports

the complete Suśrutasaṃhitā and the Sauśrutanighaṇṭu. The final colophon identifies the scribe of the MS as Vaidya Amarasiṃhaka, son of
Kamaladatta, and states the date on which he concluded the copying
of the text. Both reading the colophon, that is, deciphering the actual
characters, and the interpretation of the concerned passage involve
diverging opinions, all of which concur, however, in assigning the
MS to the sixteenth century. Klebanov (2021a: 21–26) gave an analytical account of the views expressed in literature, considered further
options, and proposed that the MS was completed on Sunday, July
29, 1543.

Editorial Principles
Method
The data for the critical edition comes from the witnesses of the Nepalese
version, described above. Diplomatic transcriptions of SS 1.16 of these
manuscripts have been created by researchers of the Suśruta Project according to a subset of TEI Guidelines that has been formulated by Charles
Li and tailored for the Saktumiva platform.12 MS Kathmandu NAK 5-333
was transcribed first because its script is relatively easy to read, the scans
are clear, it is the most complete of the manuscript witnesses, and its text
is extremely close to that of MS Kathmandu KL 699. Following that, MS
Kathmandu KL 699 and MS Kathmandu NAK 1-1079 were transcribed.
The diplomatic transcriptions were uploaded to Li’s manuscript collation platform called Saktumiva, chapter by chapter as they were completed.13 An electronic edition of the vulgate of the Suśrutasaṃhitā, that
was transcribed, without the commentaries, by Tsutomu Yamashita and
Yasutaka Muroya on the basis of Ācārya’s 1931 and 1938 Bombay editions
has also been included on the Saktumiva platform and is available for collation.14
12 See Wujastyk 2021–, The TEI Consortium 2010 and Li 2017–: “TEI Tagging”.
13 See the Saktumiva interface Li 2017–.
14 This electronic edition is also available on the SARIT website (Wujastyk, Pollock, et al.
2008–: sub “Suśrutasaṃhitā”). The version at Saktumiva has received several corrections and the intention is to merge these back into the SARIT edition eventually.

39
Saktumiva’s collation function standardises punctuation and orthographic variants according to filters which can be turned off or on.15 These
filters enable the editors to ignore daṇḍas, numbers and floral punctuation
marks (puṣpikā) in the transcripts, as well as orthographic variants, such
as ब and व, certain germinated consonants, and visarga variants. On
the basis of the automatic collation, Jason Birch created a provisional
edition of SS.1.16, which the project’s researchers read together at weekly
seminars. Manuscript images were routinely checked to verify the transcripts, particularly when a reading was uncertain; the commentaries of
Cakrapāṇidatta and Ḍalhaṇa were read, and variant readings reported by
these commentators were included in notes to the edition. Also, various
reference books were consulted, to elucidate the meaning of technical
terms and identify relevant information in other medical works.16
An initial draft of the translation and many annotations were written
by Wujastyk during the seminars as the Project researchers discussed the
text’s meaning. The transcripts, provisional edition and translation were
uploaded to the project’s repository at Github on a weekly basis.17 Therefore, the project’s work has been publicly available as it evolves. The software tools used in the project have been described on the project website.18

Stemma
The data from transcripts collated by Saktumiva can be exported as a
FASTA file and aligned according to characters, syllables or words by
a program called Helayo.19 The resulting NEXUS file can be read by
phylogenetic software to build a stemmatic tree.20 This procedure was
done with transcripts of several chapters of the Nepalese witnesses, and
the results confirmed the editors’ preliminary stemmatic hypothesis that
K and H are more closely related to one another than K and N.21 Given

40
the early date of K and the small number of other surviving witnesses
of the Nepalese version, the relationship between the manuscripts at our
disposal is reasonably clear and, in the case of SS.1.16, the manuscript data
was largely confined to N and H owing to a missing folio of K. Rather
than have to assess numerous variant readings from a large number of
witnesses, the challenge of editing has been to repair the text where it has
become corrupt in the few witnesses available to us.

The Edition and Apparatus
The critical edition of SS.1.16 in this article retains many of the peculiarities of MS Kathmandu KL 699 because the editors have endeavoured to
present to the reader a hyparchetype of the text that was transmitted by this
ninth-century manuscript. Therefore, the Sanskrit has been standardised
as little as possible and, although the text has been corrected and repaired
wherever it was corrupt in the witnesses, it has not been normalized or
conventionalized to the extent of many modern editions of Sanskrit works.
The editors have assumed that the authors of the Nepalese Suśrutasaṃhitā were familiar with Pāṇinian Sanskrit and, although there are some
non-standard spellings and grammatical forms in the text, there are very
few instances of hyper-Sanskritization, Buddhist-Hybrid Sanskrit or Epic
forms that would suggest that this assumption is unreasonable.22 Therefore, the editors of SS.1.16 have opted to retain some perhaps unfamiliar
features of the Sanskrit in MS Kathmandu KL 699 when they are grammatically correct. For example, in external sandhi, the class nasal is usually
used at the end of a word instead of an anusvāra (e.g.,1.16.3, ॰वाचनन्धात्र्य्॰),
although the anusvāra is sometimes used (1.16.15, उदकं धान्याम्ल॰). In most
cases, the consonant following a रेफ is doubled, but this is not always the
22 On the contrary, the text of the Suśrutasaṃhitā sometimes retains legitimate Pāṇinian
forms that are rare or unknown elsewhere in Sanskrit literature. For example, the term
kārmuka “effective,” formed by P.5.1.103, is virtually unknown in classical Sanskrit,
and is said even by the authors of the Kāśikāvṛtti to occur uniquely as an adjective
describing a bow. Yet it occurs in both the Suśrutasaṃhitā (1.41.5 (Su 1938: 182)) and
the Carakasaṃhitā (1.26.13 (Ca. 1941: 138)), describing “effective” drug substances. Cf.
the observation by M. Deshpande (1988: 118) that other rare Pāṇinian usages in the
early Sanskrit medical texts provide evidence that, “… in all likelihood there was a
dialect of Sanskrit closer to Pāṇini’s time and region in which [such peculiar Pāṇinian
usage existed]. This peculiarity did not exist in most other dialects of Sanskrit.”

41
case.23 Since these inconsistencies seem inherent to the transmission of the
text and may have even been authorial, the critical edition reflects them as
they occur in K and, when the testimony of K is not available, the witness
most similar to K, which is H.
The Nepalese manuscripts often have an anusvāra before a daṇḍa at the
end of a sentence or verse. Whether these anusvāras should be changed
to the consonant म्is a moot question because there is no formal Pāṇinian
concept of ‘end-of-sentence’ and his rules on sandhi are contingent on the
close contact of sounds (saṃhitā).24 However, it is reasonable to assume
that at the end of a verse, paragraph or sentence the speakers would have
paused for breath or thought, so sandhi should be applied, in which case
a final anusvāra or class nasal of the following consonant is changed to म्.
Nonetheless, this remains an assumption about how the text would be pronounced. Therefore, in a critical edition, inserting daṇḍas and changing
anusvāras to म्before them are subjective decisions by the editors. The
scribal use of daṇḍas and anusvāras in the Nepalese manuscripts can be seen
in the digital edition if one switches off the filters for ignoring daṇḍas and
final anusvāra variants.
Unconventional spellings and grammatical forms have been retained
and noted in the annotations to the translation. However, the editors have
corrected scribal errors and repaired corruptions in the transmitted text
with conjectures wherever possible. Therefore, although the edition retains many of the peculiarities of the Nepalese manuscripts, it is not a diplomatic transcript or a hybrid of diplomatic and critical editing because the
features of the transmitted text have been retained or changed deliberately,
and the reasons for doing so are given in either the introduction or, in more
specific cases, the annotations to the translation.

Digital Edition
The editors are producing both printed and digital editions of the Nepalese
Suśrutasaṃhitā. Since the print and digital environments differ markedly,
23 Examples of the germination of consonants are कर्ण्ण (1.16.1 ff), मुहूर्त्त (1.16.2), पूर्व्व
(1.16.2), गन्धर्व्व (1.16.5), ॰मूलैर् म्मधु॰ (1.16.5), वर्त्ति (1.16.6) and पुनर्व्विध्येत्(1.16.6). Examples where it does not occur in 1.16 are ॰आर्थम्(1.16.8,19), कुर्यात्(1.16.16, 32), ॰पालिर्वल्लूर॰ (1.16.10); ॰पालिर्व्यायोजिमः (1.16.10) and दीर्घैक॰ (1.16.10).

each edition has its own format.
Instructions for reading the digital edition have been provided by Li at
Saktumiva. In brief, you can generate the apparatus by choosing a base
text and one or more of the other witnesses. You can also choose to hide or
ignore in varying degrees TEI tags, punctuation and orthographical variants in the transcripts of the witnesses. On the right side of the text, the
digital edition displays an apparatus that is negative in so far as the lemma
and its witnesses are not included. This apparatus intelligently truncates
variants where possible.
For example, as seen in Figure 4.4, the apparatus for the words pratanuṃ
sūcyā bahalam ārayā is on the right side of the display. This entry means that
the editors have chosen to read pratanuṃ, which the reader must infer is attested by K, whereas A has tataḥ and N and H pratanū. Witness A has added
the word picuvartiṃ after tataḥ, omitted sūcyā bahalam ,25 and has praveśayet
instead of ārayā, which is attested by all of the Nepalese witnesses.
A popup on a dark background, as shown in Figure 4.4, displays the
manuscript sigla for the witnesses that support the selected reading, which
is labelled “NE” (“New Edition”). As seen in Figure 4.5, the positive apparatus of pratanuṃ sūcyā bahalam ārayā appears in a pop-up window in
which the lemma and variants are aligned according to letters, and the
variations are highlighted in yellow. The positive apparatus can be expanded by highlighting one or more words, and even entire passages or verses,
and clicking on the collapsed menu icon.
In both the negative and positive apparatuses of the digital edition, you
must infer conjectures and corrections by the editors. Testimonia and notes
are in the apparatus on the right side of the “provisional edition” text.
They give an opportunity for the editors to provide scholarly commentary
of various kinds, but the editors cannot write comments directly into the
25 The omitted words are displayed by hovering the cursor over [OM] adjacent to A in
the apparatus.

textual apparatus itself, since it is constructed live each time the text is displayed.
The digital form of the edition is “soft,” in the sense that editorial work
on the files that generate the critical text is potentially continuous, adding
ever greater refinement and precision. And, especially, as more manuscript witnesses come to light and are transcribed, the edition is open to
continuous enrichment.

Printed Edition
The printed edition of SS.1.16 has four layers of footnotes. The first layer
reports the witnesses that have been collated. Line numbers and lemmata
have been used to identify the witnesses that have been collated for a particular section of the text, as seen in the following example.
१–७ अथातः – ॰विद्धलिङ्गम्] MSS K, H, and N
The above entry means that a textual passage beginning with अथातः on
line 1 and ending with ॰विद्धलिङ्गम्on line 7 is attested by manuscripts K, H
and N. This layer also indicates passages that are missing or omitted in a
particular witness.
The second layer of footnotes reports the variant readings of the
Nepalese witnesses. This apparatus is negative, that is to say, only the
testimony of the variant readings have been reported, and not that of the
lemma. The following entry is an example of the apparatus’ syntax:
५ प्रतनुं ] प्रतनू N H

44
This entry means that on line five of the edition the editors have chosen
to read प्रतनुं, instead of प्रतनू , which is attested by witnesses N and H. The
reader can infer that प्रतनुं is attested by K because the first layer of footnotes
indicates that K has been collated here. In prose passages, the lemmata
and variants consist of corresponding words and, in verses, corresponding
syllables. Emendations by the editors are indicated by the abbreviation
em., and omissions and suppletions in the witnesses are indicated by om.
and add., respectively. A wavy line under a letter means that it is unclear to
the editors. Text deleted by a scribe is shown underscored by double lines,
and the scribe’s substitution is appended in quotation marks.
There are minor notational variations between the online digital edition
and the printed edition presented here. For example, a scribal “crow’s foot”
mark (काकपद), often indicating a marginal insertion, is displayed in the
digital edition as,

and in print as

The third layer of footnotes contains the variant readings of the vulgate,
which have been presented in the same format as the second layer. If a
reading of the vulgate has been accepted by the editors against different
readings in the Nepalese witnesses, the siglum for the vulgate (i.e., A) has
been placed next to lemma in the second layer of footnotes.
The fourth layer of footnotes notes includes various testimonia and
notes. The testimonia mainly consists of the variant readings noted by the
commentators Cakrapāṇidatta and Ḍalhaṇa. Those known to Gayadāsa
may be added in future publications. The notes include brief comments on
certain emendations and editorial decisions. More elaborate discussions
on such issues have been included in the annotations to the translation.
In the printed edition below, the numbering of passages has been adjusted to follow the text of the Nepalese version of the work. The numbering
of the corresponding passages in the vulgate is presented in small digits in
the right margin.

Notes

The vulgate passage inserted between 9 and 10 (from भवित चात to शािवत)् was probably
also absent in the version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā commented on by Cakrapāṇi, who cited it
in his commentary as being “read by some” in regard to the joins (सधान) that they describe
(1.16.9–13 (Su 1939: 128)).
७
् f the MSS has been emended to िवशेषतचातोपहरेत t् o make sense of the

list of ingredients, which is in the accusative case. Also, the repetition of अगोपहरणीयात in
Nepalese version suggests that its second occurrence, which does not make good sense
here, is a dittographic error.

Notes

Ḍalhaṇa, on 1.16.19 (Su 1938: 79), noted that some read राजसष र्पजं in the place of गौरसष र्पजं.
This reading appears to have been accepted by Cakrapāṇi, who glossed राजसष र्पज as वेतसष र्प
(1.16.18–20 (Su 1939: 130)). Cakrapāṇi also said that some read sarpis in the place of पयस. ्
ु
In the compound beginning with अकर् , Ḍalhaṇa noted that some read अकर् पपी.
९
N has a काकपाद after अने, but the missing letter (one would expect `न') has not been supplied in a margin or elsewhere.
१०
Ḍalhaṇa, on 1.16.23 (Su 1938: 80), noted that some read तेषामपागछेय ं िह कायर्मायतरं भवेत. ्

6 Translation of Sūtrasthāna 16
1 Now we shall expound the method for piercing the ear.1
2 One may pierce a child’s ears for the purpose of preserving and decorating. During the bright fortnight, when the child is in the sixth
or seventh month, on renowned days, half days, hours and constellations, the physician, with a calming presence, sits the boy, who has
received a benediction and the recitation of a blessing,2 on the lap of a
wet-nurse.3 Then, he should pull the ear with his left hand and pierce
1

The topic of piercing the ear (कऋनव्यध) is not discussed in the Carakasaṃhitā
(HIML: IB, 326, n. 175), but it is mentioned in some texts that followed the Suśrutasaṃhitā, such as the Kaśāpyasaṃhitā (HIML: IIA, 30). Also, the instrument for piercing the
ear is described in the Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā 1.26.26 (Ah 1939: 321). In the versions of
the text known to Ḍalhaṇa (Su 1938: 76) and Cakrapāṇidatta (Su 1939: 125), the heading of this chapter is “the method of piercing and joining the ear” (कर्णव्यधबन्धविधि),
instead of the Nepalese version’s “the method of piercing the ear” (कर्णव्यधविधि). The
topic of joining the ear (कर्णबन्ध) is discussed in passages 17–20 of the Nepalese version. However, it appears that only subsequent redactors reflected its importance by
including it in chapter headings.
The Nepalese version also omits the opening remark on Dhanvantari that appears in
subsequent versions of the text. For a discussion of the frame story in the Nepalese
version, see Birch, Wujastyk, Klebanov, Parameswaran, et al. 2021.
When commenting on this statement, Ḍalhaṇa (Su 1938: 76) and Cakrapāṇidatta
(Su 1939: 125) observed that only the ears of healthy people should be pierced, and
they quoted the lost authority Bhoja to affirm this: “When piercing the ears of children who are free of disease at these times, their ear flaps and apertures, as well as
limbs, increase” (1.16.1 (Su 1938: 76)).
Some texts use the adjective कर्ण-वेधनी rather than ॰व्यधनी.
The causative form व्यधयेत्is known in Classical Sanskrit (Whitney 1885: 166).
The compound कृतमङ्गलस्वस्तिवाचनं “who has received a benediction and the recitation
of a blessing” is an emendation based on the similar text at 3.2.25 (Su 1938: 346). Cf.
also 3.10.8, 24 (Su 1938: 388, 390) that have slightly different formulations.
The versions of 1.16.3 known to Cakrapāṇidatta (Su 1939: 126) and Ḍalhaṇa
(Su 1938: 76) have the additional compound कुमारधराङ्के (“on the lap of one who holds
the child”) after धात्र्यङ्के. The gender of कुमारधर is made clear by Ḍalhaṇa’s gloss “a man

straight through with his right hand at a naturally-occurring cleft.4 For
a boy, do the right ear first; for a girl, do the left one. Use a needle on a
thin ear; an awl on a thick one.5
3 One may know that it was pierced in the wrong place if there is excess
blood or too much pain. The absence of side-effects is a sign that it has
been pierced in the right place.6
4 In this context, if an ignorant person randomly pierces a duct there will
be fever, burning, swelling, pain, lumps, paralysis of the nape of the
neck, convulsions, headache or sharp pain in the ear.7

who holds the child.” Also, both versions add बालक्रीडनकैः प्रलोभ्य (“having enticed with
children’s toys”) to indicate that the child should be tempted with toys to stay on the
assistant’s lap. According to Ḍalhaṇa on 1.16.3 (Su 1938: 76), the toys include replica
elephants, horses, bulls and parrots. Ḍalhaṇa further mentions that others read भक्ष्यविशेषैर्वा (“or by special treats”) before बालक्रीडनकैः, but we see no trace of these small
kindnesses in our witnesses.
The versions of 1.16.3 of Cakrapāṇidatta (Su 1939: 126) and Ḍalhaṇa (Su 1938: 76) add
that this naturally-occurring cleft is illuminated by a ray of sunshine (आदित्यकरावभासिते).
The syntax of this slightly long sentence is unusual because of the dual object तौ “the
two (ears)” at the start of the sentence, which is remote from the main verb. The other
singular accusatives referring to the ear being pierced are governed by absolutives.
Ḍalhaṇa on 1.16.3 (Su 1938: 76) clarifies that the awl is a shoe-maker’s knife for piercing leather. He also cites the authority of “the notes of Lakṣmaṇa” (Lakṣmaṇaṭippaṇaka) on the issue of the thickness of the needle. The Notes of Lakṣmaṇa is not
known from any earlier or contemporary sources and was presumably a collection of
glosses on the Suśrutasaṃhitā that was available to Ḍalhaṇa in twelfth-century Bengal.
See Meulenbeld (HIML: IA, 386).
At this point, MS Kathmandu KL 699 is missing a folio, so the rest of this chapter is
constructed on the basis of witnesses MS Kathmandu NAK 5-333 and MS Kathmandu
NAK 1-1079.
This passage is significantly augmented in Cakrapāṇidatta’s and Ḍalhaṇa’s versions,
to outline the specific problems caused by piercing three ducts called कालिका, मर्मिका
and लोहितिका (1.16.4 (Su 1939: 126) and 1.16.5 (Su 1938: 77) respectively). In fact, the
order of the problems mentioned in the Nepalese version has been retained in the
other versions and divided between each duct. Cakrapāṇidatta’s commentary on
1.16.4 (Su 1939: 126) cites several verses attributed to Bhoja on the problems caused
by piercing these three ducts in the ear flap: ‘लोहितिका, मर्मिका and the black ones are
the ducts situated in the earflaps. Listen in due order to the problems that arise when
they are pierced. Paralysis of the nape of the neck and convulsions, or sharp pain
arise from piercing लोहितिका. Pain and lumps are thought to arise from piercing मर्मिका.
Piercing कालिका gives rise to swelling, fever and burning.’

5 Having removed the wick (वर्त्ति) because of the accumulation of humours or an unsatisfactory piercing at that location,8 he should smear
it with barley, liquorice, Indian madder, and the root of the castor oil
tree, thickened with honey and ghee. And when it has healed well, he
should pierce it again.9
6 He should treat the properly-pierced ear by sprinkling it with raw sesame oil. After every three days one should make a thicker wick and do
the very same sprinkling.
7 Once the ear is free from humours or side-effects, one should put in a
light dilator (प्रवर्धनक) in order to enlarge it enough.10
8 A person’s ear enlarged in this way can split in two, either as a result of the
humours11 or a blow.
Listen to me about the ways of joining it can have.
9 Here, there are, in brief, fifteen ways of mending the ear flap.12 They are
as follows: Rim-join (नेमीसन्धानक), Lotus-splittable (उत्पलभेद्यक), Dried
Flesh (वल्लूरक), Fastening (आसङ्गिम), Cheek-ear (गण्डकर्ण), Take away (आ8

In addition to these reasons, Ḍalhaṇa at 1.16.6 (Su 1938: 77) added “because of piercing with a painful, crooked and unsatisfactory needle” (क्लिष्टजिह्माप्रशस्तसूचीव्यधात्) and
“because of a wick that is too thick” (गाढतरवर्तित्वात्). Ḍalhaṇa was aware of the reading
in the Nepalese version because in his commentary on 1.16.6 (Su 1938: 77) he noted
that some read “because of the accummulation of humours” rather than “because of
piercing with a painful, crooked and unsatisfactory needle or because of a wick that
is too thick.” On the concept of humoral accumulation (समुदाय), see the important
analysis by Meulenbeld (1992).
9 The description of the drug is ambigious: the word “root” could be taken with each
plant, or just with the last. The vulgate reads just “castor oil root” so we assume that
is the traditional interpretation.
10 Cakrapāṇidatta on 1.16.6 (Su 1939: 127) and Ḍalhaṇa on 1.16.8 (Su 1938: 77) pointed
out that the dilator can be made of wood, such as that of the prickly chaff-flower,
the neem tree and tree cotton. Ḍalhaṇa added that it can also be made of lead and
should have the shape of the datura flower. The manuscripts have variant readings
for लघुप्रवर्धनकमामुञ्चेत्at this point that include a scribal emendation,
√ none of which
construe plausibly. It is possible that the unusual verb form आ+ मुच्puzzled the
scribes and caused the implausible scribal readings and emendations.
11 Ḍalhaṇa on 1.16.9 (Su 1938: 77) notes that the word दोष here can refer to either a humour, such as wind, as we have understood it, or a disease generated from a humour.
12 The Nepalese version uses the word सन्धान to refer to joining a split in an ear flap, which
is consistent with the terminology in the verse cited above (8). However, 1.16.10 of
Ḍalhaṇa’s version (Su 1938: 77) uses the term बन्ध here and at the very beginning of
the chapter (i.e., 1.16.1) to introduce the topic of repairing the ear.

56
हार्य), Ready-Split (निर्वेधिम), Multi-joins (व्यायोजिम), Door-hinge (कपाटसन्धिक), Half door-hinge (अर्धकपाटसन्धिक), Compressed (संक्षिप्त), Reducedear (हीनकर्ण), Creeper-ear (वल्लीकर्ण), Stick-ear (यष्टीकर्ण), and Crow’s lip
(काकौष्ठ).13
In this context, among these,
Rim-join:
Lotus-splittable:
Dried flesh:
Fastening:
Cheek-ear:
Take-away:
Ready-split:
Multi-joins:

both flaps are wide, long, and equal.
both flaps are round, long, and equal.
both flaps are short, round, and equal.
one flap is longer on the inside.
one flap is longer on the outside.14
the flaps are missing, in fact, on both sides.
the flaps are like a dais (पीठ).
one flap is small, the other thick, one flap is
equal, the other unequal.
Door-hinge: the flap on the inside is long, the other is small.
Half door-hinge: the flap on the outside is long, the other is small.
These ten options for joins of the ear should be bound. They can mostly
be explained as resembling their names.15 The five from compressed
(संक्षिप्त) on are incurable.16 Among these, “Compressed” has a dry ear
canal and the other flap is small. “Reduced ear” has flaps that have
no base and have wasted flesh on their edges. “Creeper-ear” has flaps
that are thin and uneven. “Stick-ear” has lumpy flesh and the flaps
are stretched thin and have stiff ducts. “Crow-lip” has a flap without
flesh with compressed tips and little blood. Even when they are bound
13 For an artist’s impression of these different kinds of joins in the ear flap, see Majno
1975: 290 (reproduced as Figure 3.2 in Wujastyk 2003: 154).
14 For an artist’s impression of this join, see Majno 1975: 291 (reproduced as Figure 3.3
in Wujastyk 2003: 155).
15 Cakrapāṇidatta on 1.16.9–13 (Su 1939: 128–129) and Ḍalhaṇa on 1.16.10 (Su 1938: 77–
78) provide examples of how the names of these joins describe their shapes. For example, the rim-join (नेमीसन्धानक) is similar to the join of the rim of a wheel (चक्रधारा).
16 Ḍalhaṇa on 1.16.10 (Su 1938: 77–78) mentions that some do not read the statement that
only five are incurable, and they understand the causes of unsuccessful joins given
below (i.e., heat, inflammation, suppuration and swelling) as also pertaining to the
first ten when they do heal.

57
up, they do not heal because they are hot, inflamed, suppurating, or
swollen.17
10 A person wishing to perform a join of any of these should therefore have
supplies specially prepared according to the recommendations of the
“Preparatory Supplies” chapter.18 And in this regard, he should particularly gather19 decanted liquor, milk, water, fermented rice-water, and
powdered earthenware crockery (कपालचूर्ण).20
Next, having made the woman or man tie up the ends of their hair, eat
lightly and be firmly held by qualified attendants, the physician considers the joins and then applies them by means of cutting, splitting,
scarification, or piercing.21 Next, he should examine the blood of the
ear to know whether it is tainted or not. If it is tainted by wind, the ear
should be bathed with fermented rice-water and water; if tainted by
choler, then cold water and milk should be used; if tainted by phlegm,
then decanted liquor and water should be used, and then he should
scarify it again.
After arranging the join in the ear so that it is neither proud, depressed,
nor uneven, and observing that the blood has stopped, one should
17 The version of 1.16.11–13 known to Ḍalhaṇa (Su 1938: 78) has four verses (श्लोक) at this
point that are not in the Nepalese manuscripts. The additional verses iterate the types
of joins required for ear flaps that are missing, elongated, thick, wide, etc. All four
verses were probably absent in the version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā known to Cakrapāṇidatta. He cites the verses separately in his commentary, the Bhānumatī (Su 1939: 128–
129), introducing each one as ’some people read’ (के चित्पठन्ति). However, in Trikamajī
Ācārya’s edition of the Sūtrasthāna of the Bhānumatī, the root text is largely identical
to the one commented on by Ḍalhaṇa (Su 1938), even in instances like this where
Cakrapāṇidatta’s commentary indicates that he was reading a different version of the
Suśrutasaṃhitā. See further the discussion on p. 6 above.
18 Suśrutasaṃhitā 1.5 (Su 1938: 18–23), probably verse 6 especially, that lists the equipment and medications that a surgeon should have ready.
19 The reading in the Nepalese manuscripts of विशेषतश्चाग्रोपहरणीयात्has been emended to
विशेषतश्चात्रोपहरेत्to make sense of the list of ingredients, which is in the accusative case.
Also, the repetition of अग्रोपहरणीयात्in the Nepalese version suggests that its second
occurrence, which does not make good sense here, is a dittographic error.
20 The term कपालचूर्ण is unusual. Ḍalhaṇa (Su 1938: 79) defines it as the powder of fragments of fresh earthen pots and Cakrapāṇidatta (Su 1939: 129) as the powder of earthenware vessels.
21 There are syntactic difficulties in this sentence. We have adopted the reading in
Ḍalhaṇa’s version (Su 1938: 78), which has च कृत्वा following सुपरिगृहीतं. It is likely that
a verb, such as कृत्वा, dropped out of the Nepalese transmission.

58
anoint it with honey and ghee, bandage each ear with tree cotton and
gauze (प्लोत), and bind it up with a thread, neither too tightly nor too
loosely. Then, the physician should sprinkle earthenware powder on
it and provide medical advice (आचारिक). And he should supplement
with food as taught in the “Two Wound” chapter.22
11 One should avoid rubbing, sleeping during the day, exercise, overeating, sex,
getting hot by a fire, or the effort of speaking.
12 One should not make a join when the blood is too pure, too copious, or
too thin.23 For when the ear is tainted by wind, then it is obstructed by
blood, unhealed and will peel. When tainted with choler, is becomes
pinched (गाढ), septic and red. When tainted by phlegm, it will be stiff
and itchy. It has excessively copious suppuration and is swollen. It has
a small amount of wasted (क्षीण) flesh and it will not grow.24
13 When the ear is properly healed and there are no complications, one
may very gradually start to expand it. Otherwise, it may be inflamed
(संरम्भ), burning, septic or painful. It may even split open again.
14 Now, massage for the healthy ear, in order to enlarge it.
One should gather as much as one can the following: a monitor lizard,
scavenging and seed-eating birds, and creatures that live in marshes
or water,25 fat, marrow, milk, and sesame oil, and white mustard oil.26
Then cook the oil with an admixture of the following: purple calotropis,
white calotropis, heart-leaf sida, country mallow, country sarsaparilla,
22 Suśrutasaṃhitā 4.1 (Su 1938: 396–408).
23 1.16.17 of Ḍalhaṇa’s version (Su 1938: 79) reads “impure” for the Nepalese “too pure,”
which would appear to make better medical sense. Emending the text to नाशुद्ध- for
नातिशुद्ध- in the Nepalese recension would yield the same meaning as Ḍalhaṇa’s version.
24 In his edition of Suśrutasaṃhitā, Ācārya (Su 1938: 79 n. 1) includes in parentheses the
following treatment for these conditions, which according to a footnote is not found
in the palm-leaf manuscript he used: ’One should sprinkle it with raw sesame oil for
three days and one should renew the cotton bandage after three days’ (आमतैलेन त्रिरात्रं
परिषेचयेत्त्रिरात्राच्च पिचुं परिवर्तयेत्).
25 For such classifications, see the analyses by Zimmermann (1999) and Smith (1994).
26 Ḍalhaṇa’s version of 1.16.19 (Su 1938: 79) includes ghee. However, Ḍalhaṇa’s remarks
on this passage and Cakrapāṇidatta’s on 1.16.18 (Su 1939: 130) indicate that they knew
a version of this recipe, perhaps similar to the Nepalese one, that did not include ghee.
Ḍalhaṇa also noted that others simply read four oils, beginning with fat and without
milk, whereas Cakrapāṇidatta said that some say it is made with four oils and milk.

59
Indian kudzu, liquorice, and hornwort.27 This should then be deposited in a well-protected spot.
15 The wise man who has been sweated should rub the massaged ear with it. Then
it will be free of complications, and will enlarge properly and be strong.28
16 Ears which do not enlarge even when sweated and oiled, should be scarified at
the edge of the hole, but not outside it.29
17 In this tradition, experts know countless repairs to ears. So a physician who is
very intent on working in this way may repair them.30
18 If an ear has grown hair, has a nice hole, a firm join, and is strong and even,
well-healed, and free from pain, then one can enlarge it slowly.31
19 Now I shall describe the proper method of making a repair when a nose is
severed. First, take from the trees a leaf the same size as the man’s nose and
hang it on him.
20 Next, having cut a slice of flesh (वध्र),32 with the same measurements, off the
27 The version of of this verse known to Ḍalhaṇa (vulgate (Su 1938: 79)) adds several
ingredients to this admixture, including prickly chaff-flower, Withania, milk-white,
sweet plants and Indian ipecac. Also, it has beggarweed instead of Indian kudzu.
When commenting on 1.16.19, Ḍalhaṇa (Su 1938: 79) noted that some do not read
sweet plants and Indian ipecac. Therefore, at his time there were other versions of
this recipe circulating, with fewer ingredients, as seen in the Nepalese version.
28 For these aims (i.e., healing and enlarging the ear), the text known to Ḍalhaṇa
(Su 1938: 79) had an additional verse and a half describing an ointment for rubbing
the ear and sesame oil cooked with various medicines for massage. Cakrapāṇidatta
(Su 1939: 131) did not comment on these verses, nor verse 15 of the Nepalese version,
and so the version of the Suśrutasaṃhitā known to him may not have included them.
29 Dalhaṇa’s version of 1.16.23 (Su 1938: 79–80) added another hemistich that stated
more explicitly that the scarification should not be done on the outside of hole as
it will cause derangement.
30 After verse 17, the 1938 edition of Ācārya (Su 1938: 80) has in parentheses nineteen
verses on diseases of the ear lobes, treatments and complications. It is possible that
these verses were in some of the witnesses used by Ācārya to construct the text as
they occur in other manuscripts, such as MS Hyderabad Osmania 137-3(b). However,
Cakrapāṇidatta (Su 1939: 132) and Ḍalhaṇa (Su 1938: 80) stated that some read about
the diseases of the ear lobes in this chapter whereas others read about them in the
chapter on various treatments (मिश्रकचिकित्स) (SS 5.25), which does indeed begin with
a discussion of the disease परिपोट. Ḍalhaṇa went on to say that some believe that these
verses were not composed by sages and, therefore, do not read them.
31 The order of verses 17 and 18 is reversed in Ḍalhaṇa’s version (Su 1938: 80).
32 The version of 1.16.28b known to Ḍalhaṇa (Su 1938: 81) reads “bound, connected (बद्धम्)” instead of “slice of flesh (वध्र).” This is a critical variant from the surgical point
of view. If the slice remains connected, it will have a continuing blood supply. This

cheek, the end of the nose is then scarified.33 Then the undistracted physician,
should quickly put it back together so that it is well joined.
21 Having carefully observed that it has been sewn up properly, he should then
fasten it along with two tubes.34 Having caused it to be raised,35 the powder of
sappanwood,36 liquorice and Indian barberry should be sprinkled on it.37
22 The wound should be covered properly with tree cotton and should be moistened
repeatedly with sesame oil. Ghee should be given to the man to drink. His
digestion being complete, he should be oiled and purged in accordance with the
instructions specific to him.38
23 And once healed and really come together, what is left of that slice of flesh (वध्र)
should then be trimmed.39 If it is reduced, however, one should make an effort
to stretch it, and one should make its overgrown flesh smooth.40

is one of the effective techniques that so astonished surgeons witnessing a similar
operation in Pune in the eighteenth century (see Wujastyk 2003: 67–70).
Or 1.16.20 could be mean, ‘… off the cheek, it is fixed to the end of the nose, which
has been scarified.’ Unfortunately, the Sanskrit of the Nepalese version is not unambiguous on the important point of whether or not the flap of grafted skin remains
connected to its original site on the cheek. However, Ḍalhaṇa (Su 1938: 81) clarified
the meaning of the vulgate here by stating that one should supply the word “flesh”
when reading “connected,” thus indicating that he understood the flesh to be connected to the face.
Ḍalhaṇa noted that the two tubes should be made of reed or the stalk of the leaf of the
castor-oil plant (on 1.16.21 (Su 1938: 81)). They should not be made of lead or betel
nut because the weight will cause them to slip down.
The Sanskrit term उन्नामयित्वा in 1.16.21 is non-Pāṇinian.
For पत्ताङ्ग (sappanwood), there are manuscript variants पत्त्राङ्ग (MS Kathmandu NAK 5333) and पत्तङ्ग (MS Kathmandu NAK 1-1079). Also, MS Kathmandu KL 699 (f. 14r:1)
has पत्त्राङ्ग in a verse in 1.14 (cf. 1.14.36 (Su 1938: 66)). The text known to Ḍalhaṇa has
पतङ्ग (1.16.29 (Su 1938: 81)) and this term is propagated in modern dictionaries.
Ḍalhaṇa glossed अञ्जन as रसाञ्जन, elixir salve (Su 1938: 81).
The expression स्वयथोपदेश is ungrammatical but supported in all available witnesses.
The vulgate transmission has lost the word वध्र and replaced it with अर्ध “half,” which
makes little sense in this surgical context.
Ḍalhaṇa accepted a verse following this, 1.16.32 (Su 1938: 81), which pointed out that
the procedure for joining the nose is similar to that of joining the lips without fusing
the ducts. He noted that earlier teachers did not think this statement on the nose and
lips was made by sages, but he included it because it was accepted by Jejjaṭa, Gayadāsa
and others, although they did not comment on it because it was easy to understand.
Cakrapāṇidatta also did not comment on this additional verse (Su 1939: 133).
