\subsection{Cakrapāṇidatta and Ḍalhaṇa's Versions}
The commentaries of Cakrapāṇidatta and Ḍalhaṇa, called the \emph{Bhānumatī} and \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha} respectively, are based on similar versions of the \SS, both of which are significantly different to the Nepalese version. Ḍalhaṇa was aware of Cakrapāṇidatta's work and reiterated many of his predecessor's remarks, so the commentator's interpretation of the root text is largely consistent. 

Trikamajī Ācārya's edition of the \textit{Sūtrasthāna} of the \emph{Bhānumatī} \citep{acar-1939} duplicates the version of the \SS\ in his edition of the \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha} \citep{vulgate}, except in a few obvious cases where Cakrapāṇidatta glosses a word or compound that is different to the one glossed by Ḍalhaṇa.\footnote{For example, in SS.1.16.18, Cakrapāṇidatta glosses \emph{rājasarṣapa} whereas Ḍalhaṇa glosses \emph{gaurasarṣapa}, and Ācārya reflects this in the root texts of the \emph{Bhānumatī} \citep[130]{acar-1939} and \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha} \citep[79]{vulgate}.} The duplication of the root text creates the somewhat misleading impression that both commentators had an almost identical version of the \SS. However, there is evidence in SS.1.16 that this was not the case. For example, Ḍalhaṇa comments on four verses (1.16.11–14, \cite[78]{vulgate}) that Cakrapāṇidatta cites separately in his commentary \citep[128–129]{acar-1939}, introducing each one as 'some people read' (\emph{ke cit paṭhanti}). This clearly indicates that these verses were not in the version of the \SS\ upon which Cakrapāṇidatta was commenting, yet Ācārya includes them in the root text of the \emph{Bhānumatī}.

Also, Cakrapāṇidatta does not acknowledge or comment on some verses in the version of the \SS\ known to Ḍalhaṇa. Although it is possible that a commentator may not have remarked on a verse because its meaning was clear, in some cases the commentarial convention of citing the first words of a new verse or passage provides firmer ground for suspecting the absence of a verse in the root text. For example, the prose passage of SS.1.16.18 in the the \emph{Bhānumatī} \citep[130]{acar-1939}, which is SS.1.16.19 in the \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha} \citep[79]{vulgate}, is followed by several verses that elaborate on the content of the prose passage, and both commentators introduce these verses and cite the opening words of the first verse before glossing specific terms. However, Cakrapāṇidatta does not introduce, cite or comment on the same verses as Ḍalhaṇa (SS.1.16.20–22ab, \cite[79]{vulgate}), and yet the first of the verses commented on by Ḍalhaṇa appears in the root text of Ācārya's edition of the \emph{Bhānumatī} (SS.1.16.19, \cite[130]{acar-1939}), and the others (SS.1.16.20–21ab) are included in parenthesis. A similar instance of this occurs at \emph{Bhānumatī} SS.1.16.31, where Ācārya includes a verse in parenthesis that was commented on by Ḍalhaṇa (SS.1.16.32, \cite[81]{vulgate}) but not by Cakrapāṇidatta. It appears that the manuscript on which Ācārya's edition of the \emph{Bhānumatī} was based does not include the root text.\footnote{See the section below on Ācārya's 1939 edition for details of the sources Ācārya used for this edition.} Therefore, the inclusion of SS.1.16.19–21ab and 31 in the root text of the \emph{Bhānumatī} is a questionable hypothesis. 

% Ḍalhaṇa 1.16.11–14
%The version of 1.16.11–14 known to Ḍalhaṇa \citep[78]{vulgate} has four verses (\emph{śloka}) at this point that are not in the Nepalese manuscripts. The additional verses iterate the types of joins required for ear flaps that are missing, elongated, thick, wide, etc. All four verses were probably absent in the version of the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} known to Cakrapāṇidatta. He cites the verses separately in his commentary, the \emph{Bhānumatī} \citep[128–129]{acar-1939}, introducing each one as 'some people read' (\emph{ke cit paṭhanti}). However,  in Trikamajī Ācārya's edition of the \emph{Sūtrasthāna} of the \emph{Bhānumatī}, the root text is largely identical to the one commented on by Ḍalhaṇa (\cite{vulgate}), even in instances like this where Cakrapāṇidatta's commentary indicates that he was reading a different version of the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā}

% Ḍalhaṇa 1.16.19–20 
%Cakrapāṇidatta \citep[131]{acar-1939} does not comment on these verses, nor verse 15 of the Nepalese version, and so the version of the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} known to him may not have included them.

% Ḍalhaṇa 1.16.32
 %Cakrapāṇidatta \citep[133]{acar-1939} does not comment on this additional verse, which suggests that either he did not know of it or was not inclined to accept it.
 
% Both commentators were aware of a version of the \SS\ that was similar to the Nepalese version % See blog.

In fact, there is some evidence that the Nepalese version was more similar to Cakrapāṇidatta's version than to Ḍalhaṇa's. For example, 1.16.5 of the Nepalese version begins with the compound \emph{doṣasamudayāt} whereas the version known to Ḍalhaṇa (SS.1.16.6, \cite[77]{vulgate}) inserts two compounds, \emph{kliṣṭajihmāpraśastasūcīvyadhāt} and \emph{gāḍhataravartitvāt}, before this. Cakrapāṇidatta (SS.1.16.5, \cite[126–127]{acar-1939}) begins his comment on this passage by glossing \emph{doṣasamudayāt}, which suggests that he was not aware of any compounds prior to this one. If one looks beyond SS.1.16, both the Nepalese version (1.1.28) and Cakrapāṇidatta's (SS.1.1.20, \cite[17]{acar-1939}) read \emph{tatrāsmiñ chāstre} whereas Ḍalhaṇa  (SS.1.1.22, \cite[5]{vulgate}) comments on \emph{asmiñ chāstre} and states that others read \emph{tatrāsmiñ chāstre}. Also, in his commentary on SS.1.1.8.1, Ḍalhaṇa (\cite[5]{vulgate}) notes the variant reading \emph{ṣaṣṭyā vidhānaiḥ}, which is not his root text but evidently was in Cakrapāṇidatta's  (SS.1.1.6, \cite[11]{acar-1939}). As discussed elsewhere (Birch 2021), the reading of \emph{ṣaṣṭyā vidhānaiḥ} is likely a corruption of \emph{ṣaṣṭyābhidhānaiḥ} in the Nepalese version (1.1.9). 




 
% Ḍalhaṇa was aware of the reading in the Nepalese version because he notes in his commentary on 1.16.6 \citep[77]{vulgate} that some read 'because of the accummulation of humours' rather than 'because of piercing with a painful, crooked and unrecommended needle or because of a wick that is too thick.'
