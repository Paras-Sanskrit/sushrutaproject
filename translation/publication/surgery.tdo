\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{yellow}{\leavevmode {\color {yellow}o}}\ I'm not too sure of the meaning of the last phrase.

\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{black}{}{yellow}{\leavevmode {\color {yellow}o}}\ This is not clear. I think you mean to say that the Nepalese mss attest to a hyparchetype rather than the archetype of the \emph {Suśrutasaṃhitā}. Our use of emendations and corrections is not proof of this, because these methods are needed whether we are constructing an archetype or hyparchetype. Signs of past redactors editing the text is possible proof (and do you have refs or examples?) but such signs might also be the result of an author's attempt to compile older materials. The point you make below about the colophons strikes me as more of a scribal issue rather than authorial one.}{10}{section*.16}%
