    \item [1] Now we shall expound the method for
    the piercing of the ear. 
    
    \item [2] One may pierce a child's ears for the purpose of preserving and 
    decorating.
    
    During the first half of the sixth or seventh lunar month,
    during a renowned day, half day, hour and constellation the child who has
    \se{kṛtamaṅgala}{received a benediction}, -- \se{svastivācana}{blessings
        pronounced} -- should be placed on the lap of a wet-nurse.\footnote{The
    syntax here is unclear. The expression \emph{svastivācana} may have been
    a gloss inserted into the text at an earlier period to clarify
    \emph{maṅgala}.  But as it stands, it is not syntactically connected to
    the rest of the sentence.  The vulgate records a reading in which the
    words are united in a compound that reads more naturally.} For a boy, do
    the right one first; for a girl do the left one. Use a needle on a
    thin ear; an \se{ārā}{awl} on a thick one.
    
    
    \item [3]  If there is excess blood or pain one should know that it was pierced
    in the wrong place. The absence of side-effects is a sign that it has been pierced 
    in the right place.\footnote{From here on, witness K is missing a folio, so the text 
    is contstructed on the basis of witnesses N and H.}
    
    \item [4] In this context, if an ignorant person accidentally pierces a 
    \se{sirā}{duct} there will 
    be fever, burning, \se{śvayathu}{swelling}, pain, \se{granthi}{lumps}, 
    \se{manyāstambhā}{paralysis 
        of the nape of the neck}, 
    \se{apatānaka}{convulsions}, headache or pain in the ear. 
    
    \item[5]     Having removed the \se{varti}{wick} in it, one should smear it with
    a paste of the roots of 
    barley, 
    liquorice, 
    \se{mañjiṣṭhā}{Indian madder}, and the
    \se{gandharvahasta}{castor oil tree},
    thickened with honey and ghee.
    
    When it has healed well, one should pierce it again.
    
    \item[6] One should treat the properly-pierced ear by sprinkling it raw sesame
    oil.   After every three days one should apply a thicker \se{varti}{wick} and
    sprinkle oil right on it.\footnote{The manuscripts support the reading
    \emph{sthūlatarīṃ} that is either a non-standard form or a scribal error.}
    
    \item[7]
    Once the ear is free from humours or side-effects, one should 
    loosen it with a light \se{pravardhanaka}{dilator} in order to enlarge it.
    
    \item[8]
    
    \begin{sloka}
        
        An person's ear enlarged in this way can split in two, either as a result of the 
        humours or as a result of a blow.  
        
        Listen to me about the \se{sandhāna}{joins} it 
        can have. 
        
    \end{sloka}
    
    Here, there are, in brief, fifteen ways of mending the ear.  They are as follows:
    Rim-join, Lotus-splittable, Dried Flesh, Fastening, Cheek-ear, Take away,
    Ready-Split, Multi-joins, Door-hinge, Half door-hinge, 
    \se{saṃkṣipta}{Compressed}, Reduced-ear,
    Creeper-ear, Stick-ear, and Crow's lip.
    
    In this context, among these, 
    \begin{description}
        
        \item[\mdseries``Rim-join'' (\emph{nemīsandhānaka}):]
        both flaps are wide, long, and equal.
        
        \item[\mdseries``Lotus-splittable'' (\emph{utpalabhedyaka}):]
        both flaps are round, long, and equal.
        
        \item[\mdseries``Dried flesh'' (\emph{vallūraka}):]
        both flaps are short, round, and equal.
        
        \item[\mdseries``Fastening'' (\emph{āsaṅgima}):]
        one flap is longer on the inside.
        
        \item[\mdseries``Cheek-ear'' (\emph{gaṇḍakarṇa}):]
        one flap is longer on the outside.\footnote{See fig.~\ref{fig:gandakarna}.}
        
        \item[\mdseries``Take-away'' (\emph{āhārya}):]
        the flaps are missing, in fact, on both sides.
        
        \item[\mdseries``Ready-split'' (\emph{nirvedhima}):]
        the flaps are like a \se{pīṭha}{dais}.
        
        \item[\mdseries``Multi-joins'' (\emph{vyāyojima}):]
        one flap is small, the other thick, one flap is equal, the other unequal.
        
        \item[\mdseries``Door-hinge'' (\emph{kapāṭasandhika}):]
        the flap on the inside is long, the other is small.
        
        \item[\mdseries``Half door-hinge'' (\emph{ardhakapāṭasandhika}):]
        the flap on the outside is long, the other is small.
    \end{description}
    
    `These ten \se{vikalpa}{options} for \se{sandhi}{joins} of the ear should be
    bound.  They can mostly be explained as resembling their names.\footnote{This
    is an odd assertion, given the strangeness of the names.}  The five below are
    not so successful:
    
    % got to here. 2021-03-12    
    
    The five from \se{saṃkṣipta}{compressed} on are incurable.  Among these, 
    “compressed” has a dry ear canal and the other flap is small.   “Reduced ear” has 
    flaps that have no base and have wasted flesh on their edges. “Creeper-ear” has 
    flaps that are thin and uneven. “Stick-ear” has \se{granthita}{lumpy} flesh and the 
    flaps are stretched thin and have \se{stabdha}{stiff} \se{sirā}{ducts}.  “Crow-lip” 
    has a flap 
    without flesh with \se{saṃkṣipta}{compressed} tips and little blood. Even when 
    they are bound up, they do not heal because they are hot, inflamed, 
    \se{srāva}{suppurating}, or swollen.
    
    \item[10]  
    
    % 15
    A person wishing to perform any of these joins should therefore gather together the
    supplies prepared according to the recommendations of the `Preparatory
    Supplies' chapter.\footnote{SS.1.5.}  And in particular, he should gather
    \se{surāmaṇḍa}{decanted liquor}, milk, water,
    \se{dhānyāmla}{fermented rice-water}, and \se{kapālacūrṇa}{powdered 
        earthenware crockery}.  
    
    Next, he should prepare the woman or man who have had the ends of their hair tied 
    up, have eaten lightly, and are firmly supported by qualified 
    attendants.
    
    Then, he should ready the \se{bandha}{bindings} and carry out the procedure with
    \se{chedya}{cutting}, \se{bhedya}{splitting}, \se{lekhya}{scarification}, or
    \se{vyadhana}{piercing}, examine the blood of the ear to know whether it is 
    \se{duṣṭa}{tainted} or not.  Then if it is tainted by wind, the ear should be
    bathed with \se{dhānyāmla}{fermented rice-water} and water; if tainted by choler, 
    then cold water
    and milk should be used; if tainted by phlegm, then \se{surāmaṇḍa}{decanted 
        liquor} and water
    should be used, and then he should scarify it again.
    
    
    Then, arranging the join in the ear so that it is neither proud, depressed, nor
    uneven, one should make the join. Next, after anointing it with honey and ghee,
    each ear should be bandaged with \se{picu}{cotton} and \se{prota}{gauze}, and
    bound up with a thread, neither too tightly nor too loosely.  Then the earthenware
    powder should be sprinkled on, and \se{ācārika}{medical advice} should be given.
    And he should supplement with food as taught in  the `Two Wound'
    chapter.\footnote{SS.4.1.}
    
    \item[11]
    \begin{sloka}
        One should avoid rubbing, sleeping during the day, exercise, overeating,
        sex, getting hot by a fire, or the effort of speaking.
    \end{sloka}
    
    \item[12]
    
    % 17
    One should not make a join when the blood is too pure, too copious, or too
    thin.\footnote{The vulgate reads “impure” for the Nepalese “too pure,” which would
    appear to make better medical sense.  Emending the text to \emph{nāśuddha-} for
    \emph{nātiśuddha-} in the Nepalese recension would yield the same meaning as the
    vulgate.} For when the ear is tainted by wind, then it is
    \se{raktabaddha}{obstructed by blood}, unhealed and will peel. When tainted with
    choler, is becomes \se{gāḍha}{pinched}, \se{pāka}{septic} and red.  When tainted
    by phlegm, it will be \se{stabdha}{stiff} and itchy.  It has excessively copious
    \se{srāva}{suppuration} and is \se{puffed up}{śopha}.  It has it has a small
    amount of \se{kṣīṇa}{wasted} flesh and it will not grow.\footnote{This passage
    exemplifies numerous small changes }
    
    \item[13] When the ear is properly healed and there are no complications,  one may
    very gradually start to expand it.  Otherwise, it may be \se{saṃrambha}{angry},
    burning, septic or painful.  It may even be split open again.
    
    
    \item [14]
    
    
    Now, massage for the healthy ear, in order to enlarge it.

    One should gather as much as one can of the following: a
    \animal{monitor lizard}{godhā}{Varanus bengalensis, Schneider}{Daniel
        1983:58},
    \se{pratuda}{scavenging} and \se{viṣkira}{seed-eating} birds, and

        The wise man who been sweated should rub the \se{mardita}{massaged} ear with

    Ears which do not enlarge even when sweated and oiled,

    \item[17]
    In this tradition, experts know countless repairs to ears.  So a

    If an ear has grown hair, has a nice hole, a firm join, and is strong and
    even, well-healed, and free from pain, then one can enlarge it slowly.

    Now I shall describe the proper method of repairing a severed nose.
    First, take from the trees a leaf the same size as the man's nose and hang it
    on him. 
    
    \item[20] Next, having cut a \se{vadhra}{slice of flesh} with the same
    measurements off the cheek, the end of the nose is then scarified.\footnote{The
    vulgate reads \se{baddham}{bound, connected} for \se{vadhra}{slice of flesh}.
    This is a critical variant from the surgical point of view.  If the slice remains
    connected, it will have a continuing blood supply.  This is one of the effective 
    techniques that so astonished surgeons witnessing a similar operation in Pune in
    the eighteenth century \citep[see][67--70]{wuja-roots3}.}
    
    Then the \se{apramatta}{diligent} physician, 
    should quickly \se{pratisandhā-}{put it back together} so that it is 
    \se{sādhubaddha}{well joined}.
    
    
    \footnote{Or
    `\ldots\ off the cheek, it is fixed to the end of the nose, which has been
    scarified'. The Sanskrit text is unfortunately not unambiguous on the
    important point of whether or not the flap of grafted skin remains connected
    to its original site on the cheek.}
