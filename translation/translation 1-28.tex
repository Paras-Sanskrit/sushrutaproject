\section{Sūtrasthāna, adhyāya 28}
    
\begin{translation}    
    \item [1] Thus, living creatures and their strength,
\se{varṇa}{complexion} and \se{ojas}{energy} are rooted in food.  That
(food) depends on the six \se{rasa}{flavours}. Thus, the flavours depend
on \se{dravya}{substance}, and substances depend on medicinal herbs. 
There are two kinds of them (herbs):  stationary and 
mobile.\footnote{\Su{1.1.28}{7}, tr.\ \volcite{1}[21]{shar-1999}.}
