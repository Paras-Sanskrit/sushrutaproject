\section{Uttaratantra, adhyāya 38}

\begin{translation}

\item [1] And now I shall explain the countermeasures against \se{yonivyāpat}{disorders of the female reproductive system}.%
	\footnote{%
	On this broad understanding of the term \emph{yoni}, see \cite[pp.\ 
	572--5]{das-orig}}

\item [2] Since for good men, a woman is the most pleasurable thing, therefore a physician should diligently attend to the diseases located in the \se{yoni}{female reproductive system}, because he is devoted to it for the sake of (people's?) happiness.%
	\footnote{%
	As our translation indicates, the sentence construction does not allow an 
	unambiguous identification of who or what is the referent of the pronoun 
	\textit{tad} in the compound form \emph{tadadhīna} ‘devoted to it.’ Our 
	current understanding is that \emph{tad} refers to the ‘most pleasurable thing’ 
	mentioned in pāda a. It could, however, also refer to ‘them,’ that is, the ‘good 
	men.’%
	}

\item [3] A female reproductive system, when morbid, cannot consume semen 
and therefore the woman does not get pregnant. She gets severe 
\se{arśas}{prolapses}, \se{gulma}{abdominal lump} and similarly many other 
\se{roga}{diseases}.
