\section{Uttaratantra, adhyāya 38}

\subsection{Introductory remarks}

\paragraph{Summary of the Content}
The chapter talks about various diseases of the female reproductive system and, in 
doing so, combines both aspects that go into a representation of diseases in āyurvedic 
literature: signs, symptoms and pathogenesis (\emph{nidāna}), on the one hand, and 
medical treatment (\emph{cikitsā}), on the other. In chapters of the 
\emph{Uttaratantra}, these two aspects are sometime dealt with in two different 
chapters X-\emph{vijñānīya} and X-\emph{pratiṣedha}. There are, however, many 
examples where this distinction is not made. 


\paragraph{Placement of the Chapter}

While in \cite{vulgate} the current chapter is found at the end of the section on 
paediatrics (\emph{Kumāratantra}, or \emph{Kumārabhṛtya} as this section is 
styled in \MScite{Kathmandu KL 699}), in the Nepalese version, this is chapter 
6.58, and it is chapter 23 of an entirely different section, namely, the 
\emph{Kāyācikitsā}.

Several things are noteworthy in this regard:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In the placement of the vulgate, this chapter follows upon 6.37 
    \emph{Grahotpatti} (6.35 in the Nepalese version), a chapter that talks about the 
    origination of nine \se{graha}{demons} that are responsible for all children's 
    diseases described in previous chapters of the \emph{Kumāratantra}. In this way, 
    the 
    current chapter retains the general focus on the \se{kaumārabhṛtya}{child bearing}, 
    but, at the same time, marks a change to a distinct, less mystical approach to the 
    topic at hand (that could originate in a cultural milieu different from that of the 
    preceding eleven chapters). Ḍalhaṇa explained how the chapter fits its context in the 
    following way \parencite[668b]{vulgate}: 
    \begin{quote}
        It is appropriate that, for the sake of treating the disorders 
        of the female reproductive system, the chapter called 
        “Countermeasures Against Disorders of the 
        Female Reproductive System” is taught immediately after the 
        chapter called “The Origination of \se{graha}{Demons}.”  It 
        is because (1) there is an explicit mention of the word “\emph{yoni}” in the 
        statement  “born in the \se{yoni}{womb} of animal and human” [in 
        SS.6.37.13bc] and because (2) the disorders of the female 
        reproductive system are the causes for the inborn disorders of children.%
        \footnote{%
            Ḍalhaṇa on SS.6.38.1: \emph{grahotpattyadhyāyanantaraṃ ‘tityagyoniṃ 
            mānuṣaṃ ca’ iti vacanena yoner nāmasaṃkīrtanāt 
            kumārajanmavikārakāraṇatvāc ca, yonivyāpaccikitsitārthaṃ 
            yonivyāpatpratiṣedhādhyāyārambho yujyate [\ldots]/}%
            }
        \end{quote}
        
        \item In the placement of the Nepalese version, \emph{Yonivyāpatpratiṣedha} is
        preceded by 6.56 \emph{Mūtrāghātapratiṣedha} (6.58 in \cite{vulgate}) and 6.57
        \emph{Mūtrakṛcchrapratiṣedha} (6.59 in \cite{vulgate}), two chapters dealing with
        the diseases of the urinary tract.  The current chapter carries on with the topic
        of diseases that affect genitalia. In its Nepalese version, the chapter opens with
        two verses that explain the reasons for treating the particular set of diseases.
        These lack any reference to the inborn disorders of children, mentioned by
        Ḍalhaṇa, and instead highlight the importance of curing female diseases for the
        satisfaction of male partner. 
        
        \item SS.1.3 in both \cite{vulgate} and the Nepalese version lists the chapter at
        the place where it is found in the vulgate (Cf.\ Sū.3.37ab:
        \emph{naigameṣacikitsā ca grahotpattiḥ sayonijāḥ}). 
        
        \item Parallel chapters in the \emph{Aṣṭāṅgasaṃgraha} and the
        \emph{Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā} form a part of the \emph{Śalyatantra} section of 
        each
        text.
    \end{itemize} 
    %In the Nepalese version, this is chapter 6.58 (\emph{Kāyācikitsā} 23) that follows 
    %upon 6.56 \emph{Mūtrāghātapratiṣedha} (6.58 in the vulgate) and 6.57 
    %\emph{Mūtrakṛcchrapratiṣedha} (6.59 in the vulgate). In the vulgate, on the 
    %other 
    %hand, this chapter concludes another section, the \emph{Kumāratantra} 
    %(\emph{Kumārabhṛtya} in \MScite{Kathmandu KL 699}), and follows upon 6.36 
    %\emph{Naigameṣapratiṣedha} (6.34 in the Nepalese version) and 6.37 
    %\emph{Grahotpatti} (6.35 in the Nepalese version).
    
    \paragraph{Parallels}
    
    The current chapter is parallel in its content to \emph{Aṣṭāṅgasaṃgraha} 6.38 
    and 6.39 as well as \emph{Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā} 6.33 and 6.34 
    (\emph{Guhyarogavijñāna} and \emph{Guhyarogapratiṣedha} respectively).%, 
    %which form a part of the \emph{Śalyatantra} section of each text.
    
    A close literary parallel to the first part of the chapter is found in
    \emph{Mādhavanidāna} (\cite{madhava}) 62, or at least its version printed in
    \citet[361]{madhava}. The readings of the \cite{madhava} as it stands now usually
    side with the vulgate version rather than with the Nepalese. In addition to the
    basic text, there are several valuable pointers made in the \emph{Madhukośa}, an
    early commentary on the \cite{madhava}. This part of the text is authored by 
    Śrīkaṇṭhadatta,
    who was most like a direct student of Vijarakṣita. The latter wrote the first part
    of the \emph{Madhukośa}, up to chapter 32, and, what is more, can be dated to the
    late eleventh or early twelfth centuries.\footcite[22--26]{meul-1974}
    
    Another most interesting parallel is found in Carakasaṃhitā 6(Ci).30.

            \paragraph{Philological Notes}
            The first two verses (2 and 3) in the Nepalese version are written in a classical 
            variety of the \emph{upajāti} metre: 
            \begin{center}
                \underline{$\cup$} $\_ \cup\ \_\ \_\ \cup\ \cup\ \_\ \cup\ \_\ \_$.
            \end{center} 
            In content, they are only approximately parallel to three hemistichs in 
            \emph{anuṣṭubh} metre found in \cite{vulgate}. The latter verses lack the 
            apologetic explanation concerning the reasons for this chapter being taught.

\begin{translation}
    
    \item [*5] \se{doṣa}{Humours}, \se{vāta}{wind}, etc., corrupted due to
\se{mithyopacāra}{faulty medical treatment},\footnote{In our translation of
    the compound \emph{mithyopacāra}, we decided for the technical meaning of the
    term \emph{upacāra}, that is, `medical application' or `treatment.' The
    combination \emph{mithyā+upa-$\surd$car} is attested several times in
    medical literature. At least once, at CS Vi.3.38, it is given an explicit
    commentarial gloss (by Cakrapāṇidatta): ``\emph{mithopacaritān iti asamyak
        cikitsitān}''. In the SS \parencite{vulgate}, it is used once in Ut.18.30,
    where it refers specifically to the wrong application of
    \se{tarpaṇa}{irrigation} and \se{putapāka}{putapāka}, both of which are
    mentioned in the previous verse. Another use of the compound in a seemingly
    conforming meaning is found in a citation from Bhoja's text quoted by Gayadāsa
    at SS Ni.5.17: ``\emph{śvitraṃ tu dvividhaṃ proktaṃ doṣajaṃ vraṇajaṃ tathā/
        tatra mithyopacārād dhi vraṇasya vraṇajaṃ smṛtam // \ldots}''. In contrast to
    this, the parallel verse in \cite{vulgate} = CS Ci.30.7 = \cite{madhava} 62.1
    reads \emph{mithyācāra} ‘wrong conduct’. All commentators (Cakrapāṇidatta on
    the CS, Śrīkaṇṭhadatta on the \cite{madhava}, and Ḍalhaṇa on the SS) explain
    that the wrong conduct stands here specifically for unwholesome diet. The
    parallel in AH Ut.33.28 = AS Ut.38.34 plainly reads \emph{duṣtabhojana}
    `corrupted food' instead.} sexual activity, fate, and also \se{doṣa}{defects}
of \se{ārtava}{menstrual blood} and \se{bīja}{semen}, produce various diseases
in the \se{yoni}{female reproductive organ}. These 20 diseases are taught here
distinctly and one by one along with their \se{bheṣaja}{treatment},
\se{hetu}{causes} and \se{cihna}{signs}. %% mithyopacāra-/ mithyācāra

\paragraph{Philological Notes} 
The Nepalese version of the SS continues here with 3 hemistichs in classical 
\emph{upajāti} metre (see the syllabic pattern above). On the other hand, 
\cite{vulgate} contains two complete verses (4 hemistichs) in the 
\emph{anuṣṭubh}. Three final hemistichs are found verbatim in CS Ci.30.7cd--8. It 
is very likely that the these verses were borrowed from the CS into SS (and not 
the other way around), because CS Ci.30.7cd = SS Ut.38.5ab says that the 20 
kinds of diseases were already taught in the \se{rogasaṃgraha}{Collection of 
    Diseases}. In the context of the SS, this reference does not make any sense and 
is left uncommented by Ḍalhaṇa. In case of the CS, however, Cakrapāṇidatta 
explains that this reference points back to CS Sū.19, a chapter that does, in fact, 
lists all the diseases dealt with in later sections of the text. 20 diseases of 
\se{yoni}{female reproductive system} as mentioned in Sū.19.3.

The above three hemistichs in \emph{anuṣṭubh} are also repeated in \cite{madhava} 
62.1--2ab. Given that all following verses stem from the SS, it is likely that 
\cite{madhava} 
62.1--2ab too was incorporated into the text from the SS (and not its original 
location in the CS).
