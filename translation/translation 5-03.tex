    \item[1] And now we shall explain the \se{kalpa}{rule} that is the required
knowledge about mobile poisons.\footnote{In contrast to stationary, plant
    poisons.  No reference is made to Dhanvantari
    \citep[see][]{birc-2021}.}\q{Come back to the issue of "kalpa".  Look up
        passages in the Kośa.}


\item[3] 

The full explanation about the sixteen \se{adhiṣṭhāna}{carriers} of the mobile
poisons, that have been mentioned by me in brief, will be
stated.\footnote{“Carrier” for \se{adhiṣṭhāna}{base, foundation} aims to capture
    the idea that the author will describe the creatures in which poisons inhere.}

    \item [6]
    \diff{The enemies of the king pollute the 
    waters, roads and foodstuffs 
    in enemy territory. The experienced physician, 
    who has learned how to purify things, 
    should clean up those polluted things.} 
    
    \item[7]
    
    Polluted water is slimy and smells of tears.\footnote{\dev{asra} normally
means “tears,” but rarely means “blood.” }  It is covered with froth and
covered with streaks. The frogs and fish die, the birds are crazed and, along with
the wetland creatures, they wander about aimlessly.
    
     \item [8]
     
     Men, horses and elephants who swim in it experience vomiting, delusion,
fever, swelling and sharp pains.\footnote{On the polysemy of \se{nāga}{elephant\slash 
snake}, see \cite{seme-1979}.} 
    He should try to purify that polluted water, after curing their ailments.
     
\item [9]

And so, he should burn
    \gls{dhava}  and 
    \gls{aśvakarṇa}, % Dipterocarpa turbanitus Gaertn., GVDB 28
        as well as
    \gls{pāribhadra}, %Erythrina suberosa, GVDB 245
        with
    \gls{pāṭalā} % GVDB 242 Stereospermum suaveolens DC.
        and 
    \gls{sidhraka} % 
        and 
   \gls{muṣkaka}, % GVDB 312, Schrebera swietenioides Roxb and 
   %Elaeodendron glaucum Pers.
        and with
    \gls{rājadruma} % āragvadha, GVDB 37 Cassia fistula Linn
        and 
    \gls{somavalka}.
Then he should sprinkle that ash, cold, on the waters.

\item [10--11]

And in the same way, putting a handful of the ash in a pot, one may also purify water that 
one wants.

If any one of the limbs of cows, horses, elephants, men or women, touch a place on
the ground that enemies have spoiled with poison, or a ford or rock or a flat
surface, then it swells up and burns and its hair and nails fall out on that
place.\footnote{``Swells up" translates an unclear reading that was probably
    \dev{śūyati}, which may be an irregular form of $\surd$\dev{śū, śvā, śvi} 
    \citep[see][175--176]{whit-root}.}

\item [12]

In that situation, he should grind up \gls{anantā} together with all the aromatic
items, with alcoholic drinks.  And then  he should sprinkle the paths that need to
be used with waters mixed with mud.\footnote{Our “alcoholic drinks” translates
    \dev{surā}.  For a discussion of this term at our period see \cite[37--39
    \emph{et passim}]{mchu-2021a}.} \diff{And if there exists another path, he should 
    go by
    that.}\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa on \Su{5.3.12}{568} cited a similar reading for the fourth
        pāda, but with a negative particle,  “and if there is no other way, one should go
        by that.”}
    
    

\item [13]

When grasses and foods are polluted, people collapse, fall unconscious. And others
vomit. They get \se{viḍbheda}{loose stool} or they die.
%\footnote{In “they get
%loose stool,” the verb \dev{ārcchanti} ($\surd$\dev{ṛ}), transmitted in both
%Nepalese manuscripts, has an irregular initial strong vowel.  Alternatively, and perhaps
%more likely, it is a combination of \dev{ā+$\surd$ṛ}, 
%conjugated unusually as a class 6 verb, but with an appropriate sense of “to fall into 
%(misfortune).”} 
One should apply to them the therapy as described.

\item [14--15]

Alternatively, one should wipe various musical instruments with antidotes that
remove poison and then play them.   What is called the most excellent paste for a
musical instrument is \gls{tārāvitāra}\footnote{“Certain minerals” translates
    \dev{tārāvitāra}, the unanimous reading of the Nepalese witnesses.  But the
    meaning of this expression is not clear and may even refer to plants, like the
    other ingredients.  The vulgate reads \dev{tāraḥ sutāraḥ}, which is also not very
    clear.  However, Ḍalhaṇa on \Su{5.3.14}{568} identified these as “silver” and
    “mercury.” This is highly unlikely to be a correct understanding of the \SS\
    passage.  Historically, mercury is not naturally present in the South Asian
    peninsula \pvolcite{5}[233]{watt-1896}, and the word \dev{pārada} that Ḍalhaṇa
    used is probably a loan-word from Persian \citep[sub \emph{paranda,
    parranda}][244b]{stei-pers}.  Mercurial compounds are not reliably attested in
    South Asia until two or three centuries after the composition of the \SS.  The
    currently available “śāstric” recension of the \emph{Arthaśāstra} that is datable
    to 175--300 \CE\ \citep[29--31]{oliv-2013} does not mention mercury (\emph{ibid},
    534).  See further the study by \citet[17, \emph{et passim}]{wuja-2013b}.} 
    together with \gls{surendragopa}, and a portion of of \gls{kuruvinda} equal to
    that, together with the bile called “brown cow”.\footnote{\dev{surendragopa} and
        \dev{kuruvinda} are both uncertain, see index. Ḍalhaṇa's opinion has been followed
        here, but it seems fair to say that all commentators were guessing.} By the sound
        of the musical instrument, even terrible poisons that may be present at that place
        are destroyed.
        
\item[16]

If there is smoke or wind that is affected by poison then birds are dazed and fall
to the ground.  People get coughs, colds, and head illnesses, and acute eye
diseases.\footnote{The syntax of this verse is somewhat loose; the vulgate has
    regularized it, smoothing out the difficulties.}

\item[17]

The smoke and air can be purified by putting into the air: 
\gls{lākṣā},
\gls{haridrā},
\gls{ativiṣā},
and
\gls{abhayā},
with
\gls{vakra},
\gls{kuṣṭha},
\gls{elā},\footnote{}\q{write footnote:  don't repeat ativiṣā; vulgate similar to H.}
and
\gls{hareṇu},
and
\gls{priyaṅgu}.

\item [18]

As it is told, the arrogant demon called Kaiṭabha created an obstacle for
lotus-born Brahmā, at the very time that he was creating these creatures.\footnote{At 
this point, the text seems to make a new beginning to the topic of toxicology, as if 
starting a new chapter.}

\item[19]
Pitiless Fury took a body and burst out of the mouth of furious Brahmā's store of fiery 
energy.\footnote{“Fury” is here anthropomorphised.}

\item[20]

He burned that great, thundering, apocalyptic demon.   Then, after bringing about
the annihilation of that demon,  his amazing fiery energy increased.

\item [21]

And so, there was a sinking down (\emph{viṣāda}) of the Daityas.   Observing that, it 
was named “poison (\emph{viṣa})” because of it's ability to produce a “sinking down.” 

\item [22] After that, the Lord created beings and subsequently made that fury
enter into creatures still and moving.

\item [23]
