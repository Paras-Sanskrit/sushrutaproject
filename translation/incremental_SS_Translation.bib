It focuses on some of the oldest manuscripts preserved in or hailed from Nepal, dealing with chronological, palaeographical, and philological issues. The aim is to illustrate that each of these issues is interesting in its own light, but at the same time it should be approached with the help of other disciplines (e.g., epigraphy, calendar history, history, etc.). The first part is devoted to the examination of the oldest Nepalese manuscripts whose date can be determined with different degrees of certitude (among others, a manuscript of the Suśrutasaṃhitā dated 13th April, 878, and a manuscript of the Skandapurāna, dated 10th March, 811). A discussion of the significance of dated manuscripts for the solution of philological problems is also provided.},
