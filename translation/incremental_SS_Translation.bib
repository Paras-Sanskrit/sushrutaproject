  annotation       = {[p.39 ff.:] On undertaking the first of the two cases to be hereafter narrated, I was induced to make such personal inquiries as were within my reach in this country, concerning the {Indian} method. I did myself the honour to write to Sir Charles Mallet, who had resided many years in {India}, and who obligingly onfirmed to me that the report, that this had been a common operation in {India}, from time immemorial; adding, that it had always been performed by the caste of brickmakers, and, that though not invariably, it was usually successful. Mr. James Stuart Hall, a gentleman who was many years in {India}, assured me, that he had seen the operation performed, and that it was of tedious length. From Dr. Barry, of the India service, I learned that he also had seen the operation; that it occupied an hour and a half, and was perfomed with an old razor, the edge of which, being continually blunted in dissection, was every moment re-set. Tow was introduced to support the nose, but no attempt to form nostrils, by adding a septum, was made. I am obligingly informed by Major Heitland, of the India service, that in {India}, several years ago, in the time of Hyder Ali, Mr. Lucas, an English surgeon, was, in several instances, successful in the operation, which he copied from the Hindoo practitioners. Boyer mentions, that the late M. Chopart once employed, in a manner, as it seems, similar to the Indian, a portion of the integuments of the neck, to fill up a void space, left by the operation for a cancerous lip\ldots . [p.100, appendix II:] Since the preceeding sheets have passed the press, some additional facts, regarding the {Indian} operation, and particularly the case of Cowasjee, have come to my knowledge. Lieutenant-Colonel Ward, of the India service, but at this time resident in London, was the commanding officer of Cowasjee, at the time when the latter was mutilated by the order of Tippoo Sultan, and also witnessed the operation performed for restoring the nose. This gentleman has done me the honour to communicate the following particulars. Cowasjee and four other native soldiers, were made prisoners by the marauding party of Tippoo Sultan. The enemy cut off the hands and noses of all the five, and then sent them back to the English, with leaves bound over the stumps oftheir arms, to stop the bleeding, but with the remains of their noses as they were left by the knife. In this deplorable state, they entered Poonah. The wounds were healed, and pensions granted to the unhappy sufferers. Some time had elapsed, when, one day, at Poonah, a native merchant came to the house of Sir Charles Warre Malet, the British resident at that city, offering for sale oil-cloth, and stating his place of residence to be four hundred miles from Poonah. A cicatrix or scar being observed on the centre of the merchant's nose, he was asked how he came by it; upon which he showed another scar on his forehead, and explained the operation he had undergone. He confessed, that he had been deprived of his nose by the executioner, as a punishment for adultery; and added, that his new one was the work of an artist ho lived where he resided, and who frequently did the ame for others. Upon receiving this account, and immediately thinking of Cowasjee and his fellows, Sir Charles Malet caused the operator to come to Poonah, where he gave new noses to all the five. It was understood at Poonah, that this operator was the only one in India; but that the art had been hereditary in his family, as we have seen it described in that of the Boianis or Boianos of Calbria, and in that of Branca in Sicily. At page 41, I have proposed the question, whether the {Indian} operators, like the ancient ones in Europe, practised the restoration of the lips and ears, as well as that of the nose. The following letter, addressed to me by Colonel Ward, gives a decided answer as to the lips; the artist who came to Poonah having expressed a wish to operate on the eldest son of the British native-ambassador at the Paishwah's court, who had lost part of his upper lip, but who, it appears, did not submit to the experiment: (COPY.) DEAR SIR, In consequence of the conversation I had with you last night about Cowasjee, who had a nose put on at Poonah, in th epresene of Mr Uhthoff and myself, when we belonged to the suite of the late Sir Charles Warre Malet, then ambassador at the above court, I eg to inform you, that the same people who put on the nose said, they were also in the habit of putting on lips; and wanted to perform that operation on the eldest son of our native ambassador at the Paishwah's court, who had lost part of his upper lip: but to this he would not although they told him they agree, had frequently done it with success. I am, Dear Sir, Your obedient humble Servant, J. WARD. November 12th, 1815. MR. CARPUE. [Gaspar Taliacozzo, Bologna, 1546--99: pioneer of nose repairs.] On pp. 36--38, Carpue reproduces the text from the Gentleman's Magazine, but has ``Findlay" for ``Trindlay" (p.37). He also says, ``The same account was subsequently engraved under a tetached portrait of Cowasjee, in which, as in the frmer, the new nose and cicatrix are marked. This portrait is engraved by Mr. W. Nutter, from a painting by Mr. James Wales, of Bombay; and published in London in the year 1793." p. 38 ``Pennant, in his View of Hindoostan, printed in 1798, gives a second description of this practice: \ldots The Hircarrah, or Madras Gazette, of August 5th, 1794, informs us, that Cowasjee, two years before, fell under the displeasure of Tippoo Sultan\ldots. This art is practised by the Koomas, a caste of Hindoos.\footnote{Pennant's View of Hindoostan, 2vols. 4to. 1798, Vol.II, page 237.}" -- p. 39. [Carpue describes, pp. 81--90 (case I), his operation imitating the {Indian} method, performed on 23 October, 1814. The operation lasted a quarter of an hour (p.86), excluding bandaging. 37 mins in all. `On the third day, I took off the dressings\ldots. and I had the high satisfaction to hear the officer, before alluded to, exclaim, from the foot of the bed, ``My G--d, there \emph{is} a nose!" Illustrated by plate 3, facing p.88.]},

Chinese historical records, popular literature and medical works and compilations indicate that it was closely related to Indian medicine. The origins of this transmission can be traced to early Chinese Buddhist canonical literature. Chinese and Indian ophthalmological works of the time are studied here, especially ophthalmic diseases like pterygium, entropion or trichiasis and cataract, which often call for surgical intervention as a way of giving curative or palliative treatment. The texts reflect upon the origin, route and nature of this transmission, and vividly depict the gradual introduction of various aspects of surgery into Chinese medicine. Indian medicine was thus a prominent contributor to the development of Chinese medicine and, especially, surgery from the seventh century A.D. onwards.},

It focuses on some of the oldest manuscripts preserved in or hailed from Nepal, dealing with chronological, palaeographical, and philological issues. The aim is to illustrate that each of these issues is interesting in its own light, but at the same time it should be approached with the help of other disciplines (e.g., epigraphy, calendar history, history, etc.). The first part is devoted to the examination of the oldest Nepalese manuscripts whose date can be determined with different degrees of certitude (among others, a manuscript of the Su{\'s}rutasa{\d m}hit{\=a} dated 13th April, 878, and a manuscript of the Skandapur{\=a}na, dated 10th March, 811). A discussion of the significance of dated manuscripts for the solution of philological problems is also provided.},

  annotation       = {03.10.22, P.10:, The people of Jeypore, until the late Maharaja's accession, were treated when sick by -- 1. Baids or Hindu physicians, of whom very few were learned. In fact, most of them knew little more than a few Sanskrit verses or sholoks which they recited as guides to the selection of particular remedies when they thought they were dealing with the disease to which these texts referred. State Baids are till subsidized in many villages. 2. Jain priests or jaties, and other priests. These depend chiefly upon the Amrit Sagar, an abridgement of Susruta, Charaka and other well-known Sanskrit authors which was drawn up in 1779--1803 by order of Maharaja Partap Singh, one of the Chiefs of Jeypore. \citep[IIa.341--2]{meul-hist} 3. Hakims or Mohamedan physicians, who practised the Yun{\=a}ni or Greek (more correctly Arabian or humoral) system of medicine. Very few of them were educated. One or two of these are still attached to each of the State regiments. 4. Jarrahs or barber-surgeons, a very poor and ignorant set of men, who bled, drew teeth, applied the actual cautery, and bandaged limbs in cases of fracture. They have great influence still, especially with the women. 5. Sathyas or couchers, who practised reclination of the crystalline lens in case of cataract. 6. Bairagis or Hindu, and fakirs or Musulman, devotees; wise women; clever persons who drive out diseases by the aid of the jharu or broom and charms. 7. Pansaries or Druggists, at whose shops Baids are accustomed to sit and practice. There are no regulations for the sale of poisons, hence there are great risks of accidents occurring. Something ought to be done in this matter. Besides all these the people resorted to temples, make pilgrimages and listened to any one (especially to the priests) who had a word to say on the subject of their diseases, and adopted the advice of any plausible individual. At the present moment it is the fashion for Hindu mothers to take their children to an old fakir who has set up a hut tow or three miles from the town. Some time ago a sweeper used to sit outside the jail gates and pretend to drive out diseases with his broom. Hindus mix up religion so much with every action, particularly where eating and drinking are concerned, that they fear to use strange, and especially European, drugs, which {5}, they think, contaminate them. Of course the greatest care is taken in our hospitals to meet this difficulty, but no doubt it is a cause for the fewer attendance of people of this class than of Mohamedans.},

  abstract         = {pp. 136 ff. argue that Hoernle misjudges the osteological remarks in the Br{\=a}hma{\d n}as, especially the {\'S}atapatha Br.  The enumeration of the bones in the Br{\=a}hma{\d n}as, says Keith, is derived from correspondences with the numbering of various verse forms, not from anatomy.

P. 138: "We must rather recognise that we are still dealing with an epoch before the systematic study of medicine and with theologians who were by no means troubled by facts in their identifications. Dr. Hoernle has, we think, laid too much stress on the passages cited from the {\'S}atapatha Br{\=a}hma{\d n}a."

Keith also undoes Hoernle's dating of the Yaj{\~n}avalkya sm{\d r}ti because he cites books of Y. that are late and attributed to {\'S}{\=a}{\d n}{\d d}ilya not Y. And therefore, too, since these texts are from the west ({\'S}{\=a}{\d n}{\d d}ilya) not the east (Yaj{\~n}avalkya) and they cannot be evidence that they borrowed from Su{\'s}ruta who was from the east.

p. 139: "There are many other points of great interest in Dr. Hoernles book. Unfortunately the doubtfulness of the chronology renders impossible any useful comparison with Greek Medicine. So far as it goes the evidence tells conclusively against Greek borrowing from India, and the possibility of Indian borrowing from thence cannot be refuted until some satisfactory evidence can be adduced allowing us to assign Caraka and Su{\'s}ruta to an earlier date than the beginning of the Christian era. Nor can it be denied that the history of Indian Astronomy tells in favour of Indian borrowing from Greece. The Greek princes of Bactria no doubt brought with them physicians trained in the Alexandrian schools in which as early as the first half of the third century B. C. an extensive system of dissection of the human body prevailed (p.IV)."},

Then, giving it a twist so that the live flesh might meet the other live surface, by healing applications they fashioned for them other imperfect noses. There is left above, between the eyebrows, a small hole, caused by the twist given to the skin to bring the two live surfaces together. In a short time the wounds heal up, some obstacle being placed beneath to allow of respiration. I saw many persons with such noses, and they were not so disfigured as they would have been without any nose at all, but they bore between their eyebrows the mark of the incision. \end{quote*} Cf.\ also I.215--6 on nose-chopping by Shahjahan's soldiers in Kashmir (ca.1635, with no reconstruction mentioned)\\ -- Letter of Mike Miles, 4 March 1999.},

  abstract         = {Intimate knowledge of {\=a}yurvedic theory is in my view an absolute requirement for any serious research on texts relating to Indian medicine. Viewed against this background the paucity of studies on theoretical concepts is astonishing. By far the larger majority of writings on Indian medicine, in particular those by Indian authors, are concerned with practice and its justification, not with its theoretical basis. Studies on philosophical concepts that form an integral part of medical thought form an exception. This state of the art, though regrettable, is easily understandable. The theory of {\=a}yurveda is intricate, the differences of opinion on all kinds of topics are numerous and the basic concepts together with the ways in which they are interconnected are far from transparent.},

Asked to tell her story, she said, as well as she could through her cut and swollen lips, that when her husband had dies, his brother had claimed her in order to get his estate; but as she was unwilling to marry him, he cut off her nose, and slit her lips, and cast her forth. She had gone straight to Bann{\'u}, and Zabita Khan had performed a very neat operation, having supplied what was wanted from her cheeks instead of her forehead, as was usual. Two quills did duty for the time as nostrils. This old Malik has always three or four patients on hand. On one occasion I saw five at his house, three women and two men. The former had lost their noses for unfaithfulness; the latter for attempting intrigues with other men's wives." Kindly sent by Mike Miles},
