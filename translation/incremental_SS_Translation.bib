It focuses on some of the oldest manuscripts preserved in or hailed from Nepal, dealing with chronological, palaeographical, and philological issues. The aim is to illustrate that each of these issues is interesting in its own light, but at the same time it should be approached with the help of other disciplines (e.g., epigraphy, calendar history, history, etc.). The first part is devoted to the examination of the oldest Nepalese manuscripts whose date can be determined with different degrees of certitude (among others, a manuscript of the Suśrutasaṃhitā dated 13th April, 878, and a manuscript of the Skandapurāna, dated 10th March, 811). A discussion of the significance of dated manuscripts for the solution of philological problems is also provided.},

  abstract         = {Although in Chinese culture surgery has not usually been seen as a major part of medical practice, during the Sui (A.D. 581--618) and the Tang dynasties (A.D. 618--907), it showed a marked flowering in the field of ophthalmology. Chinese historical records, popular literature and medical works and compilations indicate that it was closely related to Indian medicine. The origins of this transmission can be traced to early Chinese Buddhist canonical literature. Chinese and Indian ophthalmological works of the time are studied here, especially ophthalmic diseases like pterygium, entropion or trichiasis and cataract, which often call for surgical intervention as a way of giving curative or palliative treatment. The texts reflect upon the origin, route and nature of this transmission, and vividly depict the gradual introduction of various aspects of surgery into Chinese medicine. Indian medicine was thus a prominent contributor to the development of Chinese medicine and, especially, surgery from the seventh century A.D. onwards.},
