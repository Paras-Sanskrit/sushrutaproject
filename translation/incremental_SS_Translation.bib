It focuses on some of the oldest manuscripts preserved in or hailed from Nepal, dealing with chronological, palaeographical, and philological issues. The aim is to illustrate that each of these issues is interesting in its own light, but at the same time it should be approached with the help of other disciplines (e.g., epigraphy, calendar history, history, etc.). The first part is devoted to the examination of the oldest Nepalese manuscripts whose date can be determined with different degrees of certitude (among others, a manuscript of the Suśrutasaṃhitā dated 13th April, 878, and a manuscript of the Skandapurāna, dated 10th March, 811). A discussion of the significance of dated manuscripts for the solution of philological problems is also provided.},

  abstract         = {Although in Chinese culture surgery has not usually been seen as a major part of medical practice, during the Sui (A.D. 581--618) and the Tang dynasties (A.D. 618--907), it showed a marked flowering in the field of ophthalmology. Chinese historical records, popular literature and medical works and compilations indicate that it was closely related to Indian medicine. The origins of this transmission can be traced to early Chinese Buddhist canonical literature. Chinese and Indian ophthalmological works of the time are studied here, especially ophthalmic diseases like pterygium, entropion or trichiasis and cataract, which often call for surgical intervention as a way of giving curative or palliative treatment. The texts reflect upon the origin, route and nature of this transmission, and vividly depict the gradual introduction of various aspects of surgery into Chinese medicine. Indian medicine was thus a prominent contributor to the development of Chinese medicine and, especially, surgery from the seventh century A.D. onwards.},

  annotation       = {03.10.22, P.10:, The people of Jeypore, until the late Maharaja's accession, were treated when sick by -- 1. Baids or Hindu physicians, of whom very few were learned. In fact, most of them knew little more than a few Sanskrit verses or sholoks which they recited as guides to the selection of particular remedies when they thought they were dealing with the disease to which these texts referred. State Baids are till subsidized in many villages. 2. Jain priests or jaties, and other priests. These depend chiefly upon the Amrit Sagar, an abridgement of Susruta, Charaka and other well-known Sanskrit authors which was drawn up in 1779--1803 by order of Maharaja Partap Singh, one of the Chiefs of Jeypore. \citep[IIa.341--2]{meul-hist} 3. Hakims or Mohamedan physicians, who practised the Yunāni or Greek (more correctly Arabian or humoral) system of medicine. Very few of them were educated. One or two of these are still attached to each of the State regiments. 4. Jarrahs or barber-surgeons, a very poor and ignorant set of men, who bled, drew teeth, applied the actual cautery, and bandaged limbs in cases of fracture. They have great influence still, especially with the women. 5. Sathyas or couchers, who practised reclination of the crystalline lens in case of cataract. 6. Bairagis or Hindu, and fakirs or Musulman, devotees; wise women; clever persons who drive out diseases by the aid of the jharu or broom and charms. 7. Pansaries or Druggists, at whose shops Baids are accustomed to sit and practice. There are no regulations for the sale of poisons, hence there are great risks of accidents occurring. Something ought to be done in this matter. Besides all these the people resorted to temples, make pilgrimages and listened to any one (especially to the priests) who had a word to say on the subject of their diseases, and adopted the advice of any plausible individual. At the present moment it is the fashion for Hindu mothers to take their children to an old fakir who has set up a hut tow or three miles from the town. Some time ago a sweeper used to sit outside the jail gates and pretend to drive out diseases with his broom. Hindus mix up religion so much with every action, particularly where eating and drinking are concerned, that they fear to use strange, and especially European, drugs, which {5}, they think, contaminate them. Of course the greatest care is taken in our hospitals to meet this difficulty, but no doubt it is a cause for the fewer attendance of people of this class than of Mohamedans.},

  abstract         = {Intimate knowledge of āyurvedic theory is in my view an absolute requirement for any serious research on texts relating to Indian medicine. Viewed against this background the paucity of studies on theoretical concepts is astonishing. By far the larger majority of writings on Indian medicine, in particular those by Indian authors, are concerned with practice and its justification, not with its theoretical basis. Studies on philosophical concepts that form an integral part of medical thought form an exception. This state of the art, though regrettable, is easily understandable. The theory of āyurveda is intricate, the differences of opinion on all kinds of topics are numerous and the basic concepts together with the ways in which they are interconnected are far from transparent.},
