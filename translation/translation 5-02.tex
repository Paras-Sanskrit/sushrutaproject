    \item[1]
    And now I shall explain \diff{what should be known} about stationary 
    poisons.\footnote{No reference is made to Dhanvantari 
    \citep[see][]{birc-2021}. “Stationary” here is a term contrasted with “moving,” 
    and signifies plants as opposed to animals and insects.}
  
    \item[3]
    \noindent It is said that there are two kinds of poisons,
    \se{sthāvara}{stationary} and \se{jaṅgama}{mobile}. The former
    dwells in ten sites, the latter in sixteen places.
   
    \item[4]
    Traditionally, the ten are: root, leaf, fruit, flower, bark,
    \se{kṣīra}{milky sap}, \se{sāra}{pith}, \se{niryāsa}{resin}, the
    elements (\emph{dhātu})\sse{dhātu}{element}, and the tuber.

    In that context,\label{poisonousplants}

            \#442};\footnote{The roots of sweet-scented oleander are highly toxic, as
        are most parts of the plant.  Jequirity does indeed contain a dangerous
        toxin called Abrin in its seeds and to a lesser extent in its leaves,
        but apparently not in its roots or bulb.  Abrin is not harmful if eaten,
        but an infusion of the bruised (not boiled) seeds injected or rubbed in
        the eyes can be fatal \citep[no.\,6]{NK}.  The dose can be quite small.
        Large doses of the root-extract of rauwolfia can be fatal. In
        large doses luffa is emetic and a drastic purgative. The roots of both
        rose and white leadwort are very toxic.  It is at present
        uncertain whether cannabis was known in India at
        Suśruta's time \citep{meul-sear}.}

        \emph{Rasa\-ratna\-samuccaya} of pseudo-Vāgbhaṭa (21.14) says that the
        \emph{kāla\-kūṭa} poison, here translated as `jequirity', is similar to
        `\emph{kāka\-cañcu}' or `Crow's Beak', which is indeed a name for the
        plant jequirity or
        \emph{Abrus precatorius}, L., more commonly called \emph{guñjā} (not to
        be confused with \emph{gañjā}). The black seed-pod is described as
        having a `sharp deflexed beak' in botanical descriptions, so the
        Sanskrit name is quite graphic and appropriate. The poisonous scarlet
        seeds of \emph{A. precatorius} can have a distinct black dot or tip,
        which could perhaps be translated `\emph{kāla-kūṭa}', or `Black Tip'.

        Nutgrass is tuberous, but non-toxic. Atis has highly toxic tuberous
        roots. Neither sacred lotus nor galls are toxic. The `alas, alas' poison
        (\emph{hālāhala}) is the mythical poison produced from the churning of
        the ocean at the time of creation: it occurs in medical texts such as
        the present one, and commentators identify it with one or other of the
        lethal poisons such as wolfsbane or jequirity.
        \citet[126]{agra-indi} makes the intriguing suggestion
        that the word \emph{hālāhala},
        possibly to be identified with Pāṇini's \emph{hailihila} (P.6.2.38),
        may be of Semitic origin, although his evidence
        seems uncertain (\citet[1506a]{stei-pers} cites Persian \emph{halāhil}
        `deadly (poison)' as a loan from Sanskrit). \cite[iii.585]{mayr-kurz}
        also cites a claim for an Austro-Asiatic origin for the word.}
            \end{itemize}

    Thus, there are fifty-five stationary poisons.
    
    \item[6]
    There are believed to be four kinds of wolfsbane, two kinds of nutgrass, and
    six kinds of Indian mustard.  But the rest are said to be unique types.
    
    \subsection{The effects of poisons}
    \item[7--10]
    Root-poisons cause \se{udveṣṭana}{writhing}, \se{pralāpa}{moaning}, and
    \se{moha}{delirium}.  Leaf-poison is known for causing yawning, writhing
    limbs, and \se{śvāsa}{wheezing}.  Fruit-poisons cause swelling of the
    scrotum, a burning feeling, and a repugnance for food.  Flower-poisons will
    cause vomiting, \se{ādhmāna}{distension}, and \se{moha}{delirium}.  The
    use of bark, \se{sāra}{pith} and \se{niryāsa}{resin} poisons will cause
    foul-smelling breath, \se{pāruṣya}{coarseness}, a headache, and a flow of
    \se{kapha}{phlegm}.  The \se{kṣīra}{milky sap}-poisons make one
    froth,\footnote{This is indeed the observed effect of the milky sap of
    \emph{Calotropis procera}, R. Br.\ \citep[no.\,428]{NK}.} and make the tongue
    feel heavy.  The \se{dhātu}{element}-poisons give one a pain in the chest,
    make one faint, and cause a burning feeling on the palate.  These poisons
    are classified as ones which are normally lethal after a period of time.
    
    \item[11--17]
    
    \subsubsection{Symptoms of tuber poisoning}
    The tuber-poisons, though, are severe.  I shall talk about them in detail.

    With
    \plant{atis root}{śṛṅgīviṣa}{Aconitum heterophyllum, Wall.

    With
    \plant{sacred lotus}{prapuṇḍarīka}{Nelumbo nucifera, Gaertn.}{Dutt 110,

    \plant{galls}{karkaṭa}{Rhus succedanea, L.}{NK \#2136},
    one leaps up laughing and gnashing one's teeth.
    
    \item[ 19a]
    These thirteen cited poisons which originate from tubers are fearfully
    potent. Experts know them all by these ten features: they are traditionally
    said to be \se{rūkṣa}{dry}, hot, sharp, \se{sūkṣma}{rarified},
    fast-acting, pervasive, \se{vikāśin}{expansive}, \se{viśada}{limpid},
    light, and indigestible.
    
    \item[ 19b-]
    Because of their dryness they cause inflammation of the wind; their heat
    inflames the choler and blood. Because of their sharpness they unhinge the
    mind, and they cut through the connections with the \skt{sensitive
        points}{marman}.  Because of being rarified they infiltrate and disconnect
    the parts of the body. Because they are fast-acting they kill quickly, and
    because of their pervasiveness they blend with one's \skt{physical
        constitution}{prakṛti}.  Because they expand they destroy the
    \se{doṣa}{humour}s, \se{dhātu}{element}s, and the
    impurities\sskt{impurity}{mala}.  Because they are limpid they overflow,
    because they are light they are difficult to cure, and because they are
    indigestible they are hard to eliminate.  And so they cause long suffering.
    
    \item[ 24]
    One can be certain that any poison which is instantly lethal, whether it be
    stationary, mobile, or artificial, will have all ten of these features.
    
    \subsection{Slow-acting poison}
    \item[25]  
    \begin{verse}
        A poison, whether it be stationary, mobile, or artificial, which has not
        completely gone from the body, but which is worn out or damaged by
        anti-toxic medicine, or else dried up by blazing fire, wind, or sunshine, or
        which has just lost its virulence by itself, becomes a `\skt{slow-acting
            poison}{dūṣīviṣa}'\label{dusivisa}.  Because it has lost its potency it is
        no longer lethal.  It is surrounded by \se{kapha}{phlegm} and has an
        aftermath that lasts for years.
        
        \item[27]
        If he is suffering from this, his stools and complexion deteriorate, he gets
        bad breath and a nasty taste in his mouth, and is very thirsty.  He
        faints, vomits, his speech is slurred, and he is depressed.  Also, he has
        the symptoms of \skt{contaminated
            dropsy}{duṣyodara}.\footnote{\label{dusyodara}`Contaminated dropsy'
        (\emph{duṣyodara} or \emph{dūṣyudara}) is described elsewhere as a
        condition which arises when women of ill-character mix nail clippings,
        hair, urine, faeces, or menstrual blood with a man's food, in order to
        gain power over him (2.7.11--13).}
        \item[28]
        If it lodges in his \se{āmāśaya}{stomach}, his wind and phlegm become
        diseased; if it lodges in his \se{pakvāśaya}{intestines}, his wind and choler
        become diseased.  The man's hair and body are ruined, and he looks like a
        bird whose wings have been chopped off.
        \item[29a-c]
        If it lodges in one of the \se{dhātu}{body tissue}s such as the
        \se{rasa}{chyle}, it causes the diseases that were described as arising
        from the elements, and it rapidly becomes inflamed on nasty days which are
        cold and windy.
        
        \item[29d-31]
        Now listen to the preliminary signs of such a case: sleepiness, heaviness,
        yawning, \se{viśleṣa}{slackness} and \se{harṣa}{exhilaration}, and a
        \se{aṅgamarda}{chafing of the limbs}. Next, it causes
        \se{annamada}{food-mania} and indigestion, \se{arocaka}{appetite-loss},
        \se{maṇḍala}{round blotches}, \se{koṭha}{skin disease}, and
        \se{moha}{delirium}. The body tissues \se{kṣaya}{dwindle away},
        the feet, hands, and face get swollen, dropsy develops, and there is
        vomiting and diarrhoea. Perhaps his colour may drain away and he may faint
        or have \se{viṣamajvara}{irregular fever}.  It may cause heightened,
        powerful thirst.
        
        \item[32]
        \begin{sloppypar}
            These various disorders are of many different types: one poison may 
            produce
            madness, while another one may cause \se{ānāha}{constipation}, and 
            yet
            another may deplete the semen. One may cause slurred speech, while 
            another
            \se{kuṣṭha}{pallid skin disease}.
        \end{sloppypar}
    \end{verse}

    
    \item[33]
    Traditionally, `slow-acting poison' (\emph{dūṣī-viṣa}) is so called because
    it corrupts (\emph{dūṣayate)} the \se{dhātu}{body tissue}s.  This
    corruption is caused by repetitively keeping to certain locations, times,
    foods, and sleeping in the daytime.
    
    \item[34-]
    \subsubsection{The stages of slow poisoning}
    \looseness=1
    In the first shock of having taken a stationary poison, a person goes a
    brown colour, his tongue becomes stiff, he grows faint, and starts to gasp.
    \item[35]
    In the second, he trembles, collapses, has a burning feeling, as well as a
    sore throat.  When the poison reaches the \se{āmāśaya}{stomach}, it causes
    pain in the \se{hṛd}{chest}.
    \item[36]
    In the third, the roof of his mouth goes dry, he gets violent \skt{shooting
        pains}{śūla} in the \se{āmāśaya}{stomach}, and his eyes swell up and go 
        a
    nasty, yellow colour.
    \item[37]
    In the fourth shock, it causes the stomach and intestines to
    \se{toda}{sting}, he gets hiccups, a cough,  a rumbling in the
    \se{antra}{gut}, and his head becomes very heavy.
    \item[38]
    In the fifth he dribbles \se{kapha}{phlegm}, is drained of colour,
    his \se{parvabheda}{joints crack},  all his humours are inflamed, and he
    also has a pain in his \se{pakvādhāna}{belly}.
    \item[39a]
    In the sixth, his consciousness is annihilated and he completely loses
    control of his bowels.
    \item[39b]
    In the seventh, his shoulders, back and loins break, and he is finished.
    
    
    \subsubsection{Remedies for the stages of slow poisoning}
    \looseness=1
    \item[40]
    In the first shock of the poison, he should vomit and be sprinkled with cold
    water. Then he should be made to drink an \se{agada}{antidote} together
    with honey and ghee.
    \item[41a]
    In the second, he should vomit as before, and then be given a purgative to
    drink.
    \item[41b]
    In the third, it is good for him to drink an antidote and take a
    \se{nasya}{nasal medicine} as well as an \se{añjana}{eye salve}.
    \item[42a]
    In the fourth, he should drink a medical antidote mixed with oil.
    \item[42b]
    In the fifth, he should be prescribed the antidote together with a
    \se{kvātha}{decoction} of honey and
    \plant{liquorice}{madhuka}{Glycyrrhiza glabra, L.}{AVS 3.84, NK \#1136}.
    \item[43]
    In the sixth, the cure is the same as for diarrhoea.
    %
    And in the seventh, he should have medicated powder blown up his nose, and
    after having a `\se{kākapada}{crow's foot}' cut made on his head, he
    should have a piece of bloody meat put on
    it.\footnote{\label{su:kakapada}Suśruta explains the term \emph{avapīḍa}
    `medicated nasal powder' as the procedure either of administering
    \se{avapīḍa}{nasal drops}, or blowing medicated powder into the nose
    (4.40.44--46): it is particularly recommended for unconscious or incapable
    patients.  The `crow's-foot' procedure is also recommended later in the
    `Section on Procedures' (5.5.24a) in cases of snake-bite. It is also
    described by Caraka (see p.\,\pageref{sa:kakapada} below).}
    
    \item[44]
    In the intervals between each shock, assuming that the above actions have
    been performed, one should give the patient cold porridge together with ghee
    and honey, to take away the poison.
    
    \item[45--46]
