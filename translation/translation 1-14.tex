\section{Sūtrasthāna, adhyāya 14:  On Blood}


\subsection{Previous scholarship}

Meulenbeld offered both an annotated summary of this chapter as well as a
 study specifically on the place of blood
in Ayurvedic theory.\footnote{\volcite{IA}[209--201]{meul-hist}  and  
\cite{meul-1991}.  Meulenbeld's footnotes on this chapter in 
\volcite{IB}[325\,ff]{meul-hist} refer often to ``Hoernle's note.''  This appears to be 
a reference to Hoernle's copious notes to his translation of this chapter 
\citep[87--98]{hoer-1897}.}
